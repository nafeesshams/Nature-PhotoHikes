				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What skills do I need as a photographer to attend these photohikes?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>You don't need any skills at all! Our photography lessons are customized to your level, be it beginner or pro. Same applies to your equipment: whether it's a smart phone or a DSLR camera, our lessons are geared specifically to your camera and it's settings. Our lessons are broken down to two parts: specific to your camera manual settings such as white balance, exposure, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, type of lens, etc. The second part is irrespective of your camera: how to take good photos using composition, rule of thirds, leading lines, layering, etc. You learn to take great photos even with your smart phone!</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What physical ability is required in attending your photohikes?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>This is where we break down our tours into different levels, depending on your ability. Beginner hikes are easy 'walks in the park', whereas the difficult ones require experience and lots of stamina! They are not necessarily technically hard (you can do them without special equipments) but do require strength and stamina as they are long. But the views are worth the extra effort! Regardless of your ability, safety is number one so we take our time and make sure you enjoy the tour as much as possible!</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I choose the date for a tour?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>You may pick from one of our <a href="/calendar.html">scheduled tours</a> or pick your own date for a party of two or more. Once you register for a tour, we'll contact you for dates (whether scheduled or custom) and go from there.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is transportation included in all the tours?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>For the intermediate and hard hikes, we travel out of town hence we include transportation. For the easy ones, they are accessible by transit or car if you're local and can opt out of transportation; however we include transportation for visitors/travellers.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are lunch/snacks included?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Due to everyone's dietary habits and restrictions, we don't include meals. You are requested to bring your own lunch (for intermediate and hard hikes) and snacks and water for all photohikes.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Where exactly do we get picked up in downtown?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>We include pick up and drop off service to all hotel/hostel guests within downtown Vancouver. If you're staying somewhere else, eg Airbnb, we can still pick you up directly for parties of 2 or more. Either way, we will confirm a convenient pick up point prior to the tour by phone/email.</p>
