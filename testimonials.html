      <p><i>Thanks to all our guests for their wonderful reviews &#8211; taking the time to write paragraphs even &#8211; which warrants sharing all <strong>634</strong> with you! This also showcases what a wonderful place we live in, that locals often take for granted. One of the reasons I continue to lead hikes even after more than a decade is sharing our wonderful outdoors with as many people as possible, and their warm feedback is the best gratitude I can receive. <strong>Feel free to <a href="https://g.page/nature-photohikes/review?gm" target="_blank">leave a review on Google</a> if you've attended one of our tours. Thanks!</strong></i></p>
      <ul>
          <li>I’m a 50 year old woman and I had the pleasure of going on this photo/hiking adventure with Nash a week ago! I had an amazing time, saw some incredible sites, Nash gave me some really valuable tips around photo composition and also showed me how to properly use my SLR Nikon camera... I was a bit hesitant at first about going on my own with a stranger for a week but Nash was truly great! Very professional, I felt safe and he got me to hike some incredible trails!! The Parker Ridge trail, just out of Jasper was my favorite!! Thank you Nash!<br /><br />
<li>Nafees is such an amazing person. He is very considerate and patient with his guests, most of all the best tour guide I've ever met. He's very knowledgeable and passionate with travelling. He does not let a dull moment during the tour and also connected people. The itinerary was really great and flexible, lets you see the key places and breathtaking sceneries. Aside from that, he took really awesome photos and even taught us how to take photos better. It was indeed a fun, memorable and awesome trip. Kudos!<br /><br />
<li>I had such a good time on this photography hike with Nafees! He is a very friendly, warm, and personable host with lots of good photography tips. The group felt at ease and I enjoyed meeting the new people on the tour. 10/10 a great intro to my stay on Bowen Island and I would absolutely do another of Nafees’ tours!<br /><br />
<li>Great time and great pictures! It was amazing! I had a great time at the park. It is a beautiful place, easy hike, waterfalls, and the guide Nafees was really friendly and made the adventure even more interesting with his knowledge about the park and the wonderful pictures he took! I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />
<li>Me and my boyfriend had such an amazing day out with Nafees, it was so much fun. Nafees was very easy to talk to and has incredible photography skills and taught us how to use both our camera and iPhones more effectively which we really appreciate! Highly recommend!<br /><br />
<li>Nafees was an amazing host. He gave some neat tips on taking photos with cellphones that I never would have thought to find out about myself. He had very diverse knowledge set on the history of the Vancouver area and it made the experience that much better!<br /><br />
<li>A fantastic experience! He really adapts to your level of expertise and knowledge. You get some great photos and a good little look at a part of Vancouver. It was the introduction to photography that I’ve been looking for for years.<br /><br />
<li>I've been hiking with Nafees many times over the last 3-4 years. Each hike or trip is a wonderful experience full of special and fun moments. I'm following his page continuously, as I don't want to miss the next event. :)<br /><br />
<li>Excellent hike and guide. It was very easy to keep up with Nafees and he helped every step of the way. The view of the sound from the top is definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />
<li>Nafees was very knowledgeable and thorough in explanation. It is worth to explore experience with Nafees. Thank you Nafees!<br /><br />
    <li>It's a great tour through out the Stanley park.<br /><br />
      <li>This is my second time doing a guided hike tour with Nafees and I couldn’t have asked for a better person to spend the whole day with. This was the highlight of my stay in Vancouver. Once again he was very patient, kind, and a wonderful person overall with many interesting stories to share. He is so passionate about nature and photography; I’ve learned so many techniques about macrophotography in such a short period of time that I will take with me forever. It was only Nafees and I on this particular trip and it was like catching up with an old friend, I felt very comfortable. I will always do a guided hike with Nafees when I am in Vancouver!<br /><br />
      <li>Saw more this day than expected! Nafees picked us up and brought us to: Lynn Creek, North Vancouver, Stanley park, Sunset beach and Gastown. I am glad that I did this tour as I have now seen places of Vancouver that I otherwise wouldn't have. I only stayed in Vancouver for a few days and this tour made these days valuable! Nafees is an interesting guy who can give you a lot of tips/tricks about photography and he is not shy to share his stories with you.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was great. He had so much information related to Stanley park, it’s history and the way it was designed. He provided me with lots of history and background information (which was amazing to know) about the First Nation and totem poles. Though it was raining and cold he was determined to do his job till the very last minute. I really enjoyed the 3 hours tour and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />
      <li>We enjoyed snowshoeing very much. We took pictures squirrels and birds at the top of mountain.And we had a photo session, he told us how to use the camera well and how to shoot interesting with the iPhone. We were able to take beautiful photos that we have never taken before. We laughted a lot with those photos.<br /><br />
      <li>The experience was great! The host is very kind, responsible and cheerful! In addition to the activity, the photos are stunning. The route may seem like an intermediate level but Nafees motivates you to overcome any obstacle. I felt very safe!<br /><br />
      <li>Was a wonderful trekking experience! Nafees knew the entire territory well, he cared deeply and did a fantastic job sharing lots of personal stories and experiences in Vancouver, all over Canada and the world as he's also an avid traveller.<br /><br />
      <li>I've been to Vancouver a few times and this day has shown me new things in places I've been. Nafees was super attentive in making sure everyone was getting good pics of themselves or showing people how to use their camera. Thanks for the incredible day!<br /><br />
      <li>In spite of rain, Nafees taught me a lot about perspective and composition, and most interestingly using rain puddles to reflect aspects of your shot. A great experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Really enjoyed the sight-seeing experience, particularly the hike to the waterfall. Great way to see the key highlights of the city and get some good photos.<br /><br />
      <li>Great day out enjoying the stunning scenery and learning to snowshoe. Nafees was acommodating of my needs to finish promptly and helpful with supplying his own guest pictures of me in a google file (which my parents loved -thanks)<br /><br />
      <li>It was a great tour! We learned a few really useful photography tips, had a great walk around the forest of Bowen Island, the day was gorgeous and our tour guide very knowledgeable and fun! We really enjoyed the tour. Highly recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>Day was great! Beautiful place and definitely worth the hike up. Got a lot of great photos as well! Would totally do it again!<br /><br />
      <li>Thank you for your enthusiasm, let me fully experience Stanley Park, and also left a lot of wonderful photos and memories!<br /><br />
      <li>Great beginner/intermediate level hike with amazing views! A fun day trip from the city!<br /><br />

      <li>I’m very grateful to Nafees. I had the opportunity to attend Lynn Canyon Park, which was organized by him. What a wonderful expierience. Nafees shared his wide-spread knowledge with us. I learned a lot: not only about Vancouver and surrounding – we went through so many topics – our life experiences & views, politics, economics, etc. Nafees contributed with many interesting facts. I really enjoyed to have such an enriching conversation! Also he was eager to share his skills in nature photography and he explained how to use the several cameras/smartphones in an optimal way for taking amazing pictures. A friendly, good-hearted and trustful person – this is my impression of Nafees. Again: I’m very grateful that I got the chance to meet him. Dear Nafees, it was a pleasure to meet you! THANK YOU so much for the wonderful time!<br /><br />
      <li>This was my first ever Airbnb experience and I was thrilled to experience it with my best friend and her infant son, as a surprise! Nafees was AMAZING and instantly friendly so we felt welcome and comfortable. He is an expert, knowing all the best spots and landmarks where we took the photos. We did mostly a photo shoot but I did learn more about how to take the perfect shot, although I’m very amateur at photography. You can’t beat the value with this experience!! I highly recommend and will definitely do it again when I’m in town. Thank you Nafees!!<br /><br />
      <li>I have done two hikes with this tour company and they were both so much fun, but the snow shoeing photography tour was my favorite by far. Nafees is one of the best tour guides I have ever had in Vancouver! The snow shoeing hike had the transportation, equipment included, photography lessons, lots of laughs, and so much fun! I can see why snow shoeing is becoming so popular in canada its a really unique experience. On the way down the mountain there are some small down hill parts of the trail that our tour guide let us sit down and slide down it was so much fun!<br /><br />
      <li>Snowshoeing with Nafees was the best and I can’t praise this experience enough! He really knew the trial well and a lot about snowshoeing as well as photography. He was passionate and taught us how to snowshoe while providing thoughtful suggestions on photography. He also took some great shots of us! He made us very comfortable and It felt like we were hanging out with a friend. You can’t go wrong with this experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Had the best time, was only a small group of 2 of us. But it meant we could ask as many questions as we wanted. Nafees was an awesome guide, and taught me some tricks with my iPhone. It’s a great way to see the best bits of Vancouver. Can’t thank Nafees enough!<br /><br />
      <li>One of the best experiences in town. Nafees has everything organized incredibly well and is a great guide. You learn a lot from him whilst enjoying the scenic mountains surrounding Vancouver. Highly recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience to explore Vancouver and surrounding areas especially if you are only in Vancouver for a limited time.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a great host and photography instructor! I was very new with my DSLR and he gave me a quick lesson on the features of my camera and how to manipulate the light to make for better photos. I will no longer be taking pictures in auto mode! I really enjoyed the tour of Gastown and Chinatown and the great conversion and helpful instruction throughout my tour. It allowed me to take what I had learned and apply it to the rest of my trip (especially my photos of the Capilano suspension bridge!). I would highly recommend this tour with Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>If you’re in Vancouver for a couple days and don’t know how to spend it, Nafees is your guy! The whole trip was a wonderful experience and without a heartbeat I highly recommend to anyone thinking about purchasing. Nafees is extremely friendly and by the end of the night will make you feel as if you’ve known him a lifetime. Getting around Vancouver might be a little tricky for tourist since they don’t have any ride sharing apps yet so having Nafees show us what Vancouver has to offer was super helpful and we are very glad to have experienced it!<br /><br />
      <li>The experience with Nafees was truly amazing. We were only in Vancouver for a couple of days and wasn’t to sure on what activities to do. There’s no ride sharing apps so going to places would have been a lil difficult and confusing to tourists such as our selves so having Nafees with us was truly helpful. He took us to many beautiful places in Vancouver that we couldn’t imagine to do by ourselves! If we ever come back to Vancouver we will def book something with Nafees again and recommend to anyone looking.<br /><br />
      <li>He was very kind, and he changed the time and place for me. I have dslr but I&#8217;m not good at handling. He kindly taught me. Thanks to him, today was the perfect day! I should have known him early. Then I would have booked more of his tour. If you come to Seoul, Korea, I want to show you around!<br /><br />
      <li>I had a great time with Nafees! Perfect guide, really beautiful hidden gem in Lynn Canyon, nice photography technique for beginners like me, and Nafees took lots of beautiful pictures of me there. Definitely worth it!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a wonderful host, he was extremely communicative and friendly. He took great care of all of the participants and had some great photo tips/recommendations. The scenery was stunning. Fantastic day trip!<br /><br />
      <li>Perfect opportunity to escape the city rain to enjoy the mountain snow! The trail itself is easy to manage.<br /><br />
      <li>One of the best photo tours I have ever done. Nafees was very knowledgeable of the area. he knew exactly where to take you to get the best shots. I have been photographing for many years but I still had things to learn from him. Accounting us was a young lady who was a novice. He did a fantastic job of talking to her about composition, exposure and even how to post for a good photograph. He was ever willing to take your pictures. You&#8217;re extremely patient and did not rush you while you were trying to set up your tripod and get the image you wanted. He was also very good at photographing with the smartphones. He did teach us some tricks with the iPhone too. This is one trip I would highly recommend anyone who has a day in Vancouver and wants to make the most of it. Photography experience is really not needed. He can take you through the basics in no time.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great person to hangout with! Unfortunately we weren’t able to snowshoe due to low snowfall. However, Nafees was able to accommodate an alternative activity based on my interests. So we decided to go hiking at the Stawamus Chief instead! The hike was lots of fun and I had a really good time! Nafees was professional and very knowledge about the area we were hiking in! I will book Nafees’ experiences when I visit Vancouver again!<br /><br />
      <li>This should be an essential for any Vancouver trip. Spending a few hours hiking with Nafees turned out to be insightful, magical and above all rewarding. The adventure he takes you on is so beautiful and provides vivid memories that will not only remain on your camera but in your soul. Would gladly do it again!<br /><br />
      <li>This is super worthy! I couldn&#8217;t express enough how much I enjoy this trip. Supreme location selection, easy to meet up, and very useful tips for improving your photography skills. Feel super grateful for this wonderful day. highly recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>Amazing trip!! We had an impromptu change of plans due to a lack of snow and ended up visiting some beautiful waterfalls on the way to Whistler. No matter what activity you get to enjoy, Nafees will ensure you have the best possible experience.<br /><br />
      <li>This was our favorite experience of our week-long trip! Had never snow-shoed before, but Nafees expertly showed us how to use them and gave us advice along the way that helped us learn and become more confident. The hike itself was absolutely gorgeous, and we had the added benefit of falling snow that day. Great elevation change, not too strenuous, but felt challenged. Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone traveling through Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is such a great host. He is professional with photo shooting he taught my daughter lot of skills to take a nice photos. He will take very nice pictures during the trip after that you can get really nice photos. And he have big patient to understand every customers. so we have no problem to communicate. The place he recommended us to have a lunch it’s all tasty. We highly recommended to join his group.<br /><br />
      <li>We joined Nafees’ Bowen island tour few days ago we really like it. So this time we booked a full day private tour. He arranged very well. The trail he took us to hike, and many of nice photos shooting places, downtown of Vancouver, local foods, etc., we really enjoyed it. And we got lots of nice photos from Nafees. If you want to see Vancouver nice spots you should join Nafees’ group.<br /><br />
      <li>Was a nice hike, Nafees is really passionate about hiking, the nature and gave some insightful photography tips.<br /><br />
      <li>Great guide to take you snowshoeing on Seymour. And he shared his pictures after the hike &#8211; they were awesome!<br /><br />
      <li>A wonderful experience, Nafees is an excellent and knowledgeable host and the locations and scenery for our hikes were magical. I thoroughly recommend Nafees&#8217; tours 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>This is a great experience to get immersed in nature and friendship. Nafees is very knowledgeable about photography and shows great hospitality.<br /><br />
      <li>I couldn’t find point of location, mainly my fault, we started late, but host was really good at finding me and was very patient, so I really appreciated that. This host is very much an expert with cameras and with taking good shots, I learned a few things from him in this respect.<br /><br />
      <li>I found Nature Photo Hikes using TA &amp; google. We were on a Pacific NW cruise with a full day in Vancouver. I contacted the website about designing our day in port &amp; had quick responses from Nafees who agreed to pick us up at the port &amp; planned a full day with trips to Lynn Canyon &amp; Quarry Rock. Our group was composed of just 3 of us as my husband was sick. Nafees picked us up at the port in rain. I asked Nafees if we passed a pharmacy, could we make a quick stop to pick up medicine for my husband. We were close by one &amp; made the stop where I was able to buy what my husband needed &amp; I appreciated Nafees accommodating my request. After a brief stop, it was on to Lynn Canyon. It was a very rainy &amp; overcast day, but we made the most of it. We arrived at Lynn Canyon at a good time before hordes of people descended. We had a great walk over a suspension bridge &amp; through majestic woods to a beautiful waterfall. The rain &amp; overcast skies made for some interesting photos and Nafees was great about giving us tips on how to use our iPhones as well as my Nikon. I definitely learned a lot &amp; picked up some very good tips. Following this part of our day, our jeans were soaked &amp; we talked about going to a store to buy rain pants. Nafees took us to MEC where he patiently waited while we shopped &amp; tried on clothes. We each found a pair of rain pants which I immediately changed into in the store, getting out of my wet jeans. With the rain, Nafees gave us an option of changing our tour, but it was decided we would go to Quarry Rock as initially planned. We arrived in Deep Cove and had a great lunch at a small place with awesome donuts. We walked around the lake &amp; saw where they were actually filming a movie. Nafees said their area is known for filming many Hallmark movies. We made our way to the trail up to Quarry Rock. This hike has been described as easy, but for me (a flatlander living at the beach &amp; at sea level), it was not easy in any way, but a challenge. Nafees was very supportive &amp; let us go at our own pace &#8211; as fast or as slow as we desired. He was very patient &amp; made the whole experience a pleasure. The rain had stopped enough that when we arrived at the big rock, there was no rain &amp; we basically had it all to ourselves. It sounds like that never happens, so the inclement weather was a blessing in disguise. The view was spectacular &amp; we enjoyed taking our time wandering around &amp; taking photos. It was well worth the climb &amp; we were all happy we had stuck with our original plan &amp; were able to experience Quarry Rock. After a full day, Nafees returned us to the port to board our ship. Nafees was a pleasure to deal with in setting up this tour &amp; also on the tour itself. He was personable &amp; very accommodating. In planning, he offered to combine the 2 tours with a discount on the 2nd one which was very nice &amp; it was incredibly wonderful for it to be just us in a small group. We cruise often &amp; I always look for other options rather than the ship&#8217;s tours &amp; I would highly recommend Nature Photo Hikes &amp; Nafees to anyone looking for a day in Vancouver. Thanks Nafees!My husband and I did the photo walk through Stanley Park and English Bay with Nafees. It was just the two of us, and Nafees catered the experience to our (beginner photographer) abilities. He showed us simple tips on composition and light exposure that made our shots (just on our cell phones) look amazing!! He also sent us all the photos he took on the walk. Beyond the photography, Nafees was just a really nice and interesting guy, and we enjoyed our afternoon with him.<br /><br />
      <li>This experience was incredible. It really allowed me to get away from the hustle and bustle of Vancouver and enjoy the natural beauty of Canada. The landscapes were breathtaking. The hike itself is manageable even for an inexperienced hiker like myself. Nafees is also very familiar with the terrain and provided some really interesting insights. The pictures provided after the experience were beautiful as well. Would highly recommend.<br /><br />
      <li>This was a great experience for a beginner photographer like myself. Since it was just me with Nafees tonight doing the Gastown night photography I got great one-on-one tips and tricks with Nafees and got great shots. Also, I learned a lot of new things aboutmy camera that I never knew of before since Nafees showed them to me. Thanks so much for the great photos and even better memories!<br /><br />
      <li>This experience was AMAZING!!! Nafees is so friendly and accomdating. He really helped me get some good shots. He knew all of the best spots for photos and best times to access them. I really enjoyed learning how to take better photos with my smartphone (which I always have on hand). I would highly reccomend this experience when you are visiting Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>Best. Day. Ever. I can’t rave enough about our tour guide, Nafees! I’m a 33 year old female and I came to Canada on a solo travel trip. I felt very safe and looked out for! I didn’t know what to expect and didn’t want to hike alone up to Garibaldi Lake which is why I booked this. I’m an experienced hiker, but even if you aren’t sure you could complete this 18km round trip adventure- have faith that Nafees will help you with lots of patience and guidance! The views are worth the pain! He is a phenomenal photographer and helped me learn how to shoot my Nikon better. He took a lot of excellent pictures that I will cherish forever! No other guide I know would have done this; let alone have fun doing so! It’s easy to tell he enjoys his work. Thank you, Nafees! I will be back for another adventure!<br /><br />
      <li>Lynn Canyon is a MUST if your in Vancouver and Nafees is the expert to do this with. Nafees is knowledgeable, charismatic and patient. He gave us great tips on how to use our camera phones for the best pictures. He made sure we went at the perfect time when there would be less people. At times it almost felt like we had the park to ourselves. The park is magnificent and 100% less crowded than other parks. He shared his knowledge of photography, hiking, history and even recommended places to eat. We took public transportation there and back and felt completely safe and happy to be among the locals. Nafees was so kind as to take us all the way back to our place on public transit which helped us navigate the city the rest of the week. It was priceless. This experience was beyond my expectations. I highly recommend taking Nafees&#8217; tour. It was my favorite tour on this trip.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was an excellent tour guide for this experience. I would never have been able to navigate and do this by myself for the first time. He brought so much insight into the basics of hiking as well as taking time to go over my camera settings to capture some very beautiful photography along the way. He was always looking out for us and our well-being It was great to have a group and everyone was smiling ear to ear even with the difficult elevation challenges. We saw waterfalls, various insects, beautiful rock walls and forest along with some very special chipmunk friends that were enjoying our lunch with us. I will certainly be joining Nafees the next time I return to Vancouver for another adventure. . The experience is amazing and it was medicine for my soul.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a very experienced and knowledgeable hiker, and is very personable, patient and kind. He made sure everyone was comfortable and going at their own pace, while making sure we were all safe when it started to rain. He demonstrated how to do some things when it got to the difficult parts of the hike which I found super helpful. I also really liked Nafees telling us his personal stories of his hikes in Vancouver and Africa, you can tell he genuinely loves hiking, talking to people, and photography. Plus, he taught us MANY things about photography and took beautiful pictures of us! I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to complete this hike alone, thank you Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>This tour was by the far the best money we spent in Vancouver. It was the highlight of our short trip to the city. Nash took us to all the main places to see in Vancouver, which was great since we didn’t want to rent a car, or spend our time navigating a city we weren’t familiar with. Plus, he not only taught us about our camera settings and the compositions of our photos, but he also took dozens and dozens of photos of me and my husband. It was like having our own private photo session! The day was organized well, with a great mixture of driving, walking, and sightseeing. I HIGHLY recommend this tour. Thanks Nash!<br /><br />
      <li>The Lynn Canyon Hike &amp; Photography tour with Nafees was a great way to spend a day in Vancouver. We were lucky to be the only two people signed up for our tour, and got some really great pointers from Nafees &#8211; both about photography and about Vancouver in general. I would recommend this tour to any friend who plans to visit Vancouver in the future!<br /><br />
      <li>We had a brilliant day in Vancouver with Nafees! As a beginner, I learned a lot about my camera and my friend, way more skilled than I am, also learned a lot! The day went by so fast and we learned a lot about the city. Nafeez took us to a variety of places so we could capture Vancouver’s beautiful landscapes, city scapes, night time shots, forest, beach, the list goes on! An incredible day out, whatever the weather!!!<br /><br />
      <li>This was a fun day trip from Vancouver! The hike itself can be a bit tedious, but it is totally worth it when you see the beautiful views of Garibaldi Lake. I would even say it is more beautiful than the highly touristy destination lake louise in Banff. Nafees took many breaks and photos of us along the way, and taught some basic photography. Such a great day, and would highly recommend.<br /><br />
      <li>It was an awesome experience ! The spots Nafees chose were too good and it felt magical by looking at the shots captured. Nafees and another guest Puneet were very welcoming and friendly. Nafees explains you very nice and interesting photography techniques making your captured photos look like a professional photographer. He took loads of pictures in various types of shots. Nafees is very accommodating and I’m glad I did this tour! Would recommend everyone for this tour to get capture awesome moments of their visit in Vancouver!!<br /><br />
      <li>A wonderful experience to feel how Vancouver is. Hiking in the wood to see the beautiful view is really gorgeous! Thumb up for this . The city walk is also impressive, especially taken photos by only iPhone can make make pictures so nice. Throughout the tour, Nafee is nice and professional and his professional skill in hospitality and photo taking made us unforgettable. Will definitely recommend my friend to find him for tour. Value for money!<br /><br />
      <li>This tour was a great day from beginning to end. Nafees takes care of all aspects of the planning so all you have to do is enjoy. The snowshoe trail was beautiful, and accessible for a beginner. Getting the chance to take lots of photos and learning about techniques of photography was really fun too.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a wonderful time on this trip. Nafees is very experienced and took the time to share tiny details about the trail and its features. It was a truly amazing experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees offered this hike as a replacement for the Quarry Hike. I went with my husband and adult daughter. A very different and beautiful hike. I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />
      <li>I can&#8217;t give this experience a high enough review or recommend it enough!! Nafees made sure everyone was set and took lots of breaks while hiking to make this a super enjoyable experience for someone at any skill level. We stopped at a restaurant after the hike as well and the food there was to die for. He also provided me with a few other restaurants to check out later that night for supper and made this experience super memorable. Had an awesome time and I would definitely recommend Nafees as a guide for any hike you want to do in BC!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a true professional and expert at his craft. We learned so much about photography and that beautiful park. He also took pictures of me proposing to my girlfriend and the set up and everything was perfect! He was an absolute pleasure to work with and go on a tour with. Highly recommend!!<br /><br />
      <li>In one word, Nafees is great! He knows the place very well and you will have so much fun talking with him during the trip. He has so many stories to tell and many tips to give if you plan to stick around some days more. He&#8217;s a great photographer and will lead you to his &#8220;secret&#8221; places so you can get the best pictures. Thank you Nafees!!! We all enjoyed the time spent with you.<br /><br />
      <li>This was my second hike with Nafees who knows his hood to the core. I enjoyed a pleasant forest hike and stunning views of Deep Cove. If you are not much of a photographer Nafees will gladly take the shot for you. I will gladly join on another hike anytime the opportunity arises.<br /><br />
      <li>Excellent tour of Lynn Canyon. Saw many amazing things and got some incredible photographs. I also learned a few good photo tips! I highly recommend Nafees, he’s very knowledgeable about the area. He knows just where to go and everything felt very easy &#8211; I couldn’t have done this hike on my own.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was very friendly and helpful host who has deep knowledge about the Gastown and downtown area. Also gave me a lot advises about my future tour. I got several nice photos with this experience and definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try this experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees provided a very interesting combination of easy hiking, exploration and photography. I learnt simple but really useful tips to use my iPhone to take shots of moving water and still objects, as well as to enhance the colour layers of beautiful landscape. Tour is highly recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>This tour is something you should definitely not miss! I learnt so much about picture shooting and my pictures turned out excellent! I enjoyed Nafees&#8217; knowledge of the photography. Definitely one of my highlights from my trip, totally recommend it.<br /><br />
      <li>During my time in Canada, the best hike was with Nafees. When we went to Garibaldi Lake, nice people and amazing day. I will never forget it. He is also a great photographer! Thanks so much!!<br /><br />
      <li>This is the third time I book a tour for me and my Friends with Nafees who has always been kind and an wonderful host. He not only shows you around but also gives you amazing tips to great pictures!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great guide in leading us on this hike. He showed us various photography techniques that enhanced the pictures we took throughout the hike. I found myself more interested in doing other hikes in the future. Highly recommended.<br /><br />
      <li>I enjoyed this hike around North Vancouver! Nafees was very personable and always made sure to check up on us as we were hiking. He kept good pace, allowed us to take photos and I learned a lot of cool tricks. He eagerly took photos of us also and I enjoyed talking to him. I’d go on another tour of his soon!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great tour guide of the park and taught me very helpful tips for better landscape photography. He also gives a good overview of Vancouver and activity/restaurant recommendations. Highly recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>Very nice hike on Mt. Seymour. Scenic location. Nafees is a very patient and friendly person. I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone who is around Vancouver and interested in a hike.<br /><br />
      <li>Absolutely amazing experience hiking in Joffre Lakes! Nafees was an expert who really was able to get the group to mingle and was very welcoming. The hike was incredible and Nafees knew of perfect locations to take us on this hike to give us a personalized experience! Definitely looking forward to more hikes with Nafees and would strongly recommend this experience to any keen hiker!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees&#8217; tour to Lynn Canyon was a great experience. We are very grateful that it was flexible and will support us to get to the site. During the tour he shared his experiences and we discovered incredible tricks with the camera. The place is unique, it allows you to be in touch with nature, visit a suspension bridge and beautiful waterfalls. Thank you Nafees for sharing your passion for Vancouver with us, much success.<br /><br />
      <li>Great hiking tour. It&#8217;s a nice trail with beautiful views. Somewhat challenging but very doable for beginners or intermediate hikers. Nafees was kind enough to check in with everybody multiple times to make sure the pace is right. He also shared great photo tips with the group and helped us take some nice memories. Thank you!<br /><br />
      <li>This is my first time to participate in the AirBNB experience, really great, Nafees is good, humorous, considerate, able to take care of everyone, taught me how to use the old IPhone which can shoot amazing pictures, and taught the hidden function in IPhone that helps me to shoot. The beauty here is so beautiful, I will participate in the event next time, thank you.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great teacher, and I learned a lot about the features of my camera on this tour. There were five of us and he took the time for each of us to explain everything so that you could really understand it. He chose a great location for these lessons. Apart from photography, the hike was great fun, and we were rewarded with a beautiful view. I thought the tour was so good that I booked the photo tour in Gastown for the next evening.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is really knowledgeable about the outdoors, nature, and photography, and was overall a great guide. He showed me tips on how to fully maximize my camera features on both my phone and my mirrorless camera. We went to beautiful locations in Lynn Canyon that I wouldn’t have known about if I just went by myself. He also took great photos and delivered them in a timely manner. Overall it was a great experience and foray into Northern Vancouver and Lynn Canyon!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a superhost who will guide you through hiking if the trail is hidden. The tour was easy to walk and easy to understand about the camera. During the summer, he seems to have many other hiking tours, and if I had another chance, I would like to go again. Since it is a guide for beginners, it is recommended even for Japanese people.<br /><br />
      <li>Hike was really great, Nafees really knows how to get great pictures no matter what camera or phone you have and he knows areas that will get you away from the crowds to really enjoy nature. I wish I was around Vancouver for longer so I could go on more of his hikes.<br /><br />
      <li>I do really recommend the trip with Nafees. He gave me a lot of helpful instructions and ideas for camera settings and compositions, he was really interested and friendly. The Lynn Canyon is awesome , that makes it easy to take nice pictures or Just enjoy the landscape.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees led us to the suspension bridge, and then on to several paths with gorgeous natural environments. Although I &#8220;only&#8221; had my iPhone, he showed me some new features that I now continue to use. Our group of 5 ranged in age from young adults to senior citizens and Nafees made sure that we all had a great time, according to our comfort level &amp; physical ability. I shared a few photos with my daughter who is a film editor / photographer &amp; she said &#8220;Wow, Mom, did YOU take these photos?&#8221; She was impressed by the lighting &amp; composition &amp; some of my newly learned iPhone photo features. Thank you, Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees had great tips for photography, both on the camera phone and DSLR. I was actually amazed at how much the iphone camera could do. He brought us to great places for photos and we saw a lot in addition to being outdoors with great hiking and views for photos. Not a standard historical and sight seeing tour but really enjoyable and Nafees is a great host for Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was kind enough to let me 3 year old tag along for our afternoon in Lynn Canyon. I have a reasonable handle on my DLSR but Nafees encouraged me to take total control and get off auto mode. We experimented with long exposures and he guided me to getting the perfect shot. Stunning location for an afternoon photography lesson!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great host and really knows his stuff. It’s an easy walk that is suitable for beginners. His off the beaten path trail helps you beat the crowds and into some spectacular scenery. A great intro walk if getting into hiking and for those more experienced, like myself, it’s a great way to meet new people and learn some new camera skills.<br /><br />
      <li>I enjoyed the walk through Lynn Canyon Park in the beautiful crisp Fall weather. Nafees is professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. As an avid iPhone user, I was happy to learn new tips and tricks to take beautiful photos in nature. Also it is great to see Lynn Canyon from unique perspectives that was shared along the way.<br /><br />
      <li>This is a great experience and a must do in Vancouver for all hike lovers. We had a great experience and he took us to a secret pathway w a little more challenging route. It was very fun and definitely a beautiful view as a trophy when you get to the top.<br /><br />
      <li>This hike with Nafees was incredible! We had a great group of people and the hike was well worth the effort. Having Nafees to guide us and give more context to the area and history was invaluable and not something you could get on your own. A really great experience overall!<br /><br />
      <li>Wonderful experience, hiking through the secret paths made me enjoy the rain forest even more than expected, finishing on top of the mount to appreciate the beauty of the city, sea and surrounding mountains definitely a must-do for nature lovers.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is an excellent guide with worldwide experience in hiking. We only brought our smartphones and he still showed us some very cool tricks and gave us tips on how to take shots in the future.<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience fulfilled of knowledge. All my questions were properly answered and now I am looking forward to practice by myself!!! Thanks!!!<br /><br />
      <li>Had an amazing hike with Nafees, really was one of the most beautiful hikes I&#8217;ve been on, everyone on the day was so friendly and we got some amazing photos would highly recommend it<br /><br />
      <li>It was a rainy day so I worried but it was a better experience !! It was special to use public transportation that was hard to come by alone, and it was great to clear the spots and to explain the techniques and contents of photography in detail! It was a more enjoyable experience with caring for me. It is recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>I had booked this tour because I was already convinced of it at another event the day before. Although my English is not very good, and it had foreign vocabulary, he was able to convey it to me very well. I learned a lot about photography and also had fun on this tour.<br /><br />
      <li>It was a great hike with spectacular views and we got awesome looking photos. Nafees is a great hiking guide, taking care of everything, he knows the best spots and shared great stories with us. Highly recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>Great evening/night tour of Gastown and Chinatown. Nafees knows the area well and pointed out all the great spots for photos. Great tutorial as well on basics of photography and how to get the best out of whatever camera you bring &#8211; including iPhones!<br /><br />
      <li>Must to do in Vancouver. I booked the experience because all buses were fully booked and it was quite complicated to go to the lake. Nafees was very experienced and took care of all members. Strongly recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>The trip to Lynn Canyon was wonderful. The views were fantastic and Nafees is very knowledgeable with photography.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a very caring guide and we felt the whole stay very very comfortable. The Island was a great experience for our first day. Even with a jet lag 😉<br /><br />
      <li>It was really cool. Would definitely go on another longer Tour with him. When returning to Canada I will make sure to look it up.<br /><br />
      <li>Awesome trip with a amazing fellow traveler.<br /><br />
      <li>It was a challenging hike but the scenery at the top was totally worth it. I was very glad that the trip was not cancelled even with few people signed up. Nafees was super knowledgeable with hiking and photography skills. In addition, he was really good at controlling the pace and encouraging us to make it to the top. So we had great conversation on the hike and shared good information. Highly recommend for a day trip to anyone who is visiting Vancouver! Thank you so much.<br /><br />
      <li>Definitely an experience I&#8217;ll cherish and remember forever. It&#8217;s challenging. Going all the way up to the top and then going down was definitely difficult, but with Nafees&#8217; help I did it. He made sure everyone was comfortable at their own pace and helped in the sections that were more difficult, showing us exactly how to do it. If you&#8217;re up for a physical challenge and you&#8217;re not too afraid of heights, I recommend you do this experience. You&#8217;ll have memories for life.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is amazing. He is very friendly and also really funny. He has so much experience in hiking , he helps you out and gives you all the time you need. We went on 2 hiking activities with him and both were absolutely amazing. I recommend this to everyone. Bowen island was really beautiful and Nafees took a lot of beautiful pictures of us.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great guy, who will make sure you understand your camera and will help you take great photos. The walk in the park was excellent and he timed it perfectly so we had the bridge almost to ourselves, with barely anyone else there. Definitely recommended.<br /><br />
      <li>First time hiking tour with education on how to take photographs and use camera. This was a fantastic experience. As 1st timer, I greatly appreciate the time, effort and feed backs. This will definitely help in future hiking. The group was awesome, great sense and cohesive.<br /><br />
      <li>This experience was really a treat. Nafees was a thoughtful and adept instructor who has developed a great way to teach people about photography. The hike was beautiful and Nafees used that to show us the principles of different styles of photography.<br /><br />
      <li>Good chance to see beautiful views, very easy climb and close to Vancouver by bus&#8230;.Nafees was a very friendly and helpful host. Thank you.<br /><br />
      <li>Squamish was really fun. Nafees is very friendly and also funny. He was patient and took a lot of beautiful pictures.<br /><br />
      <li>A well organised and fun day out ! Would definitely recommend Nafees as a guide and photographer.<br /><br />
      <li>I was on a solo trip to BC in mid-September, when I stumbled upon this photography tour of English Bay. I meant to go to English Bay and Stanley Park, but figured a tour might be better. Since it was raining, I ended up being the only person on the tour with my guide Nafees, so the experience was very personalized. Nafees was a fantastic host. He showed me the best places to see the views, told me a little about each stop, and still made time to show me awesome food options on Denman. Nafees even took (and shared with me) excellent photos which perfectly captured my experience. I would highly recommend this tour, its great exercise and Nafees will make the trip out, regardless of the size of your group, and weather conditions. Even for solo travellers like myself.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a good hiking guide who was patient and knowledgeable about Giribaldi and the surrounding areas of Vancouver. I learned some photography tips from him and he was very nice about taking photos of us individually and as a group. I enjoyed the hike and the fact that I didn&#8217;t have to worry about transportation and hiking alone/getting lost! We came back into town a little and Nafees was kind enough to drop us all off at the places we were staying. Thank you Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>This hike was amazing with beautiful views and mini obstacles that made it challenging! Nafees was the best guide! Great communication before and throughout the trip, very knowledgeable, and took wonderful photos. I would definitely recommend this experience to any and all visitors who want to get out to Squamish for a day trip!<br /><br />
      <li>This was a great hike. We met some really lovely people who shared the same passion for walking and adventure. It was a small group so it felt very personal. The views were amazing at the top. Nafees was knowledgeable, friendly and read the group dynamic well. I thoroughly recommend this hike.<br /><br />
      <li>Thank you Nafees for this tour. It was really a pleasure and we learned a lot about photography 😉<br /><br />
      <li>Really nice hike with a very special view at the top!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees&#8217; tour was a fantastic experience. Despite the park being very busy due to beautiful weather, Nafees quickly adapted his tour to take me to the less busy spots and we managed to avoid the crowds very well. He showed me a lot of unknown spots, which gave the tour a very unique feeling. When it came to photography Nafees took the time to show me all the different settings on my camera, I learned a lot. He brought a lot of patience, not only with explaining camera settings but also when it came to waiting at the bridge to get the perfect shot without tourists even on a fairly busy day such as ours. Afterwards Nafees stayed behind to help me get a good night sky shot even though it wasn&#8217;t part of the paid experience. I can definitely recommend this hike, beautiful nature, good photos and a nice tour guide.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a wonderful day with Nafees. I appreciated his confident guidance on the sections of the hike that were challenging for me. I certainly could not have done this hike on my own. I also appreciated his passion for the outdoors and his enthusiasm to share with people. I also learnt some new photography skills and it was wonderful that Nafees also took group and individual photos. It was a great day. Thank you Nafees.<br /><br />
      <li>I cannot recommend an experience with Nafees enough. He clearly has a love for the outdoors and photography, which he shared with me. Nafees is a very thoughtful guide &#8211; he took what I wanted to see and learn into consideration and curated the best experience for the setting. He also taught me some helpful photography skills that I am excited to use in the future.<br /><br />
      <li>If you love nature, hiking and would have always liked to take better pictures, this is your tour! Skip Capilano Bridge park and its hordes of tourists and join Nafees in a calmed, beautiful, easy hike. Grab your camera or mobile and put on your trekking shoes (sneakers also valid), and enjoy nature while learning. Nafees is a great guide, excellent at giving picture taking tips, and with a sensational sense of humor. You’ll have a great time, don’t hesitate!<br /><br />
      <li>I highly recommend this tour, was one of my top 3 best experiences in Vancouver, Nafees knows widely how to take advantage of the tools you have to take the best photos, and he makes you feel comfortable all the journey, a great experience!!<br /><br />
      <li>A fantastic trip with the most excellent guide, Nafees. Conquering The Chief with him is a must-do!!<br /><br />
      <li>Highly recommend this experience with Nafees. His ability to guide groups at all levels and keep a steady but comfortable pace was wonderful. I LOVED the fact that he was an expert photographer and made the experience extra unique by showing us his hidden gem spots and photographing us through the whole journey. His passion for the land was evident, and contagious! I appreciated when he shared stories that made me learn more about the region and landscape. The hike itself is medium effort &#8211; not for elderly or those who are not in good physical condition. However &#8211; if you&#8217;re pretty fit it will be a nice solid workout. My favorite part was getting to the chains and seeing the amazing view from the peak. Drinking water from the waterfalls was also a highlight of my experience! Epic day!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was great. He picked us up on time and was very friendly. We took the bus to Lynn Canyon which was great to see parts of the city I had not visited yet. It went very smoothly. The hike was amazing, and Nafees really knows the location well as he took us to the less visited sections and then finished in the most busy parts when most tourists had left. He taught us some cool tricks on how to use my phone for better pictures and went at our pace. Its clear he really enjoys what he does! I would really recommend to go one of his hikes.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a really warm and engaging host! The experience, though introductory, had its unique challenges as well and Nafees was quick to share useful tips and trip throughout. He was also very patient and would keep to a pace which we were all comfortable with. Did I say he is also a remarkable photographer too? Overall, the trip was pleasant &#8211; would encourage everyone to explore one of Vancouver&#8217;s natural assets with Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>The Squamish Hiking and Photography experience is wonderful. The description is absolutely true, it is not the easiest walk &#8211; or as the sign at the beginning of the trail says &#8211; it is not a stroll in the park. But it is so well worth it! The views were amazing. Everybody took good photos + Nafees took great shots with each participant with their own camera. He certainly knew the nest spots from where to take the photos. Also there was a really good vibe in the group 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees provided a wonderful experience in a way that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to replicate on our own. Not only did he give us tips and tricks to better use our equipment (I have an iPhone &amp; my husband has a Fuji), he also showed us areas we wouldn&#8217;t know were accessible on our own, as well as took lots of pictures of us that we wouldn&#8217;t have gotten on our own. It was almost like we were on a wonderfully different engagement photo shoot (we are happily married)&#8230; we walked away with beautiful pictures from Nafees, broadened skills, and memories of a place that we wouldn&#8217;t have gotten if we were left to our own devices. So glad we booked this experience!<br /><br />
      <li>The experience was fantastic. The hike was very nice and Nafees ensured that the pace was suitable for everyone. There were lovely spots for photos and he made sure that everyone was happy with their cameras. Thanks a lot!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees&#8217; hike to Lake Garibaldi was nothing less than spectacular! His level of experience in guiding hikes like this was unparalleled. He was very informative when it came to flora and fauna of the area and provided us with some great pro tips for trying to capture some of the beauty via photography. I would highly recommend this trip for anyone who may be contemplating a trip to Lake Garibaldi.<br /><br />
      <li>It was an amazing experience!! A hard hiking but really worth it. Garibaldi lake is wonderful, beautiful views, peace and silence. I enjoyed the company of Nafees. I recommend this experience to every people visiting Vancouver!<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience! Needed some work climbing up but the view was amazing. No one else signed up so it was just me and Nafees, the tour still happened. Nafees brought his camera and took a lot of pictures for me, which was awesome. Recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>This was an amazing experience, I was nervous about booking alone but the interactions with Nafees and with the other people on the trip were lovely. It was a gorgeous hike and a great day.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a really responsible, kind and experienced tour guide. I had plenty of fun during our hiking. The view was spectacular and the experience is wonderful! Highly recommended.<br /><br />
      <li>It&#8217;s been an amazing afternoon and definitely a good value. Nafees is such an awesome guy and makes you feel very welcome right from the beginning.<br /><br />
      <li>Got some great pictures and learned a few tricks to take better shots with my iPhone. 5 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />
      <li>The experience was great! The spot was very cool and totally recommend it.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was awesome! Very personable and catered to the different interests of the group. He did a great job keeping the atmosphere light, but informative &#8211; the photography tips alone were worth the $$. The recommendations he made for the rest of our trip were right on the mark.<br /><br />
      <li>This was awesome! It is definitely labeled a difficult hike for a reason. But Nafees was very patient and understanding and we still made good time. The views on this hike are unforgettable. Just be prepared with comfortable shoes and lots of snacks and hearty lunch!<br /><br />
      <li>Great tour with a great guide! He was very knowledgeable about the rain-forest and photography&#8230;how to take better pictures. Been 8 years since I was in Lynn Valley and I enjoyed it very very much! It&#8217;s absolutely beautiful over there! I totally recommend this for anyone wanting to get out of the city.<br /><br />
      <li>Great time in Vancouver on this walking tour and photography workshop. Nafees is a pro and knows Vancouver inside and out. Whether you have a DSLR or smartphone cam he can provide great tips and u walk away with some great images.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a fantastic guide! The hike was a great experience and Nafees ensured everyone in the group was happy and safe. A wonderful day- highly recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>This hike and Nafees was awesome, nice morning hike and lunch with a view. I absolutely loved it. Must stop for honey doughnuts after.<br /><br />
      <li>Really fun, fairly easy hike and lots of great photo tips!<br /><br />
      <li>This hike is well worth it! The views are gorgeous and Nafees is great!<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience with helpful tips to take nice pictures!<br /><br />
      <li>I booked this tour last minute while in Vancouver and was really glad I did. Nafees was a really great guide. The only camera I had with me was the one on my iPhone, but even with that, he showed me great ways to take better pictures. He knew the best spots to take interesting pictures. He was super personable and made it a fun experience.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a lovely time &#8211; our group was friendly and kind as well as Nafees! I really liked the time spent focusing on photography Nafees made sure to take time to show everyone their settings and tips and tricks. The hike itself was pretty challenging but in a good way and it is worth it!<br /><br />
      <li>The hike was fantastic and the views on top of the mountain were stunning. Nafees takes extra care to make sure the pace is sustainable for all hikers at all ability levels. He also customizes his photography tips/instruction to meet his guests knowledge &amp; interest levels. Great experience.<br /><br />
      <li>This was a fantastic experience and provided a fabulous day out into a very unique part of the world! Nafees tailored the experience to match the group and provided insight to the area and showed us some cool and local spots! Would thoroughly recommend! Thanks Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>This was a great way to get in a fun hike in our trip to Vancouver. Nafees was a great guide and had a lot of cool tips to share with us about using just our phones to take amazing pictures. Highly recommend booking this experience!<br /><br />
      <li>This was a great trip. Nafees was very friendly, knowledgeable and took good care of us. He took us to his secret beautiful spots with amazing view of the park where we could practice taking photos. His knowledge about photography was great and shared many tips with us. Overall a great experience!<br /><br />
      <li>The hiking is very nice, with a nice forest and wonderful views at the top, but what makes the difference is Nafees (guide and teacher of photography in this tour). We’ve learned a lot of tips from him. And the group is small.<br /><br />
      <li>Highly recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>Such an amazing experience. If you&#8217;re thinking about it at all just do it, you will not be disappointed. Nafees is very accommodating and knowledgeable.<br /><br />
      <li>We had a great hike in a beautiful place! Also the camera tips were so useful; found aspects of my camera phone that I never knew existed.<br /><br />
      <li>This review is long, long overdue but I wanted to take the time to highly recommended the Garibaldi Lake Hike, which I did last July with my girlfriend while visiting Vancouver. While no doubt a challenging hike, it was an incredible experience and definitely the highlight of my trip to Vancouver. Nash was just THE BEST guide for our hike. He could not have been a nicer, more knowledgeable, more experienced or more supportive guide for what was a fairly difficult hike for both me and my girlfriend (something we did not totally anticipate). There were certainly a few times during the hike where we were struggling or asking what we got ourselves into ; ) But Nash was there to cheer us on and help us get to the top where the lake is, and it was totally worth it. The views once you reach the lake are just breathtaking, totally spectacular. I have a collection of photos taken at Garibaldi Lake that I will treasure forever. Nash was also very helpful with taking some great shots of us on his camera and the camera we brought as well. It is also great that he was able to pick up and drop us off directly at the hotel we were staying at in Downtown Vancouver, which was pretty awesome after a long and exhausting hike. I cannot recommended a better experience if you are interested in hiking or exploring the outdoors of Vancouver. Overall, just an entirely fantastic and rewarding experience that I will never forget. I look forward to returning to Vancouver soon so I can join Nash on a new hike in beautiful Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>What a wonderful experience with Nafees &#8211; this is an opportunity not to be missed! The tour starts with a bus ride to Lynn Canyon which takes about 30-40 minutes. Once the hike began, Nafees guided us through this spectacular forest, taking us to places where we could try various settings on our cameras. At each stop Nafees helped us choose the right settings, taking individual time until we each got great shots. The hike is an easy trail, with lots of stairs and beautiful scenery. Nafees is highly knowledgeable and connects well with everyone. Nafees also took beautiful pictures of those of us in the group and sent them to us the day following the tour. I was in Vancouver for a conference and had a very limited amount of time to site see and I am SO pleased that I did this!!!<br /><br />
      <li>Totally recommend this photography tour with Nafees, 10/10! He was very knowledgeable about the area, he knew all the good spots to practice taking photos. Also very knowledgeable about photography whether you had a DSLR or camera phone. We definitely picked up photography tricks which we put to use during the rest of our trip! We also appreciate that he sent us and shared the photos he took of us after. The other guests in the group were also lovely, so we enjoyed this tour of Lynn Canyon. Thank you so much for the newfound photography tips and skills we learned from you, Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>A terrific experience! Nafees is a genuine soul with a good sense of humor and he is knowledgeable about the area, trees and plants. I have been wanting to use my camera in manual mode for a couple of years and Nafees was able to keep the photography instruction casual and basic &#8211; he gave just enough instruction to make me feel comfortable taking photos in manual mode. He also talked about composition and light/shadows. Overall it was a wonderful experience! I highly recommend it!<br /><br />
      <li>We thoroughly enjoyed our photography experience with Nafees. Lynn Canyon is a stunning place and not too busy. We had just bought a new camera for our trip to Canada so it was an excellent few hours spent getting to know our way around the camera. Nafees showed us some useful pointers on how to take great shots in different lighting and how to capture moving subjects. We’ve really enjoyed taking long exposure shots on our trip as we’ve visited a few waterfalls! Nafees also took the experience at our pace and we never felt rushed. A very enjoyable experience and comes highly recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>I spent an enjoyable time hiking, practicing photography with a knowledgeable, friendly instructor.Nafees took time to give individual help with each camera and skill level. I learned how to photograph waterfalls, forest scenes with various light, interesting compositions. We reviewed camera settings, ISO, white balance,F-stops,aperture. Overall a very positive experience which I recommend to anyone wishing to get out of the downtown area and experience nature and learn Photography skills as well.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a great hiking experience with Nafees to Garibaldi Lake. He made the experience very comfortable for all of us, stopping at a cafe if we needed anything, and was explicit that fast/slow hikers are all welcome (though we happened to all hike at the same pace :). The hike itself was beautiful and we lucked out on a great day weather wise. It&#8217;s uphill on switchbacks for the first 6km with lots of rewarding views after. Nafees was a friendly, easygoing guide with lots of stories. I would definitely look at his other hikes next time I&#8217;m back.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a great time on the hike and was very happy with the route and the spots Nafees has selected for us. As a photographer, I spent quite a bit of time in some spots, just trying to get the right shot and I didn&#8217;t feel rushed. I loved all the spots we got to see and what I learnt about the area. Very pleasant and insightful hike!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees has a great ability to communicate his love for the natural wonders around his city. Through his lens, he let&#8217;s you fully appreciate the beautiful angles of Lynn Canyon. He is a sensible person, eager to share wit you his respect for the balance between nature and humankind. He can answer all questions: from technical matters related to photography to sociological aspects of his city, his country and the world. Great experience!<br /><br />
      <li>The tour was a bliss! We hiked in a small group and got to know each other a little. There were some challenging moments on a way as I’m afraid of the heights but Nafees was very reassuring and the breathtaking views were the best reward for me! We have also learnt a lot from Nafees about hiking in general, he made sure that we were using the right techniques throughout the day. It all made for a very relaxing day despite the steep hike!<br /><br />
      <li>Great hiking adventure to Squamish &#8211; incredible views! Nafees was a wonderful and expert guide, very knowledgeable and friendly. Would recommend this hike and Nafees anytime!<br /><br />

      <li>Was a wonderful morning exploring, learning some great tips and got some beautiful photos of me and dad. I look forward to doing it again when more out of town guests visit. He showed some great viewpoints and ways of capturing it.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was great and helped me with basics of photography. He is an humble, polite and knowledgeable in this field. There is nothing like learning from him while sightseeing.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a wonderful tour guide! He is caring and embodies hiking passion and expertise that really enriched the experience. This was the highlight of my trip to Vancouver!<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience! We had very little knowledge about photography and left feeling mildly adequate hahaha very friendly and a nice walk around Stanley Park.<br /><br />
      <li>A great way to discover parks around Vancouver and to learn photography. Its an easy hike and beautiful forest.<br /><br />
      <li>Great guide, very knowledgeable. We had a fun time and learned a lot!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was fantastic! Easy going, flexible, welcoming, and knowledgeable. He reintroduced me to photography basics that changed my photography game. We very much enjoyed our photo tour with him and would choose it again given the chance!<br /><br />
      <li>I’m so impressed by this experience! Wonderful place, Nafees was so friendly and nice, we took thousand of amazing pictures, I met amazing girls, how can it even be better? Thank you again for this great time, I recommend it for everyone who is exploring BC.<br /><br />
      <li>He is a really great talent. If you get lost, you should participate. I was able to shoot better with a single-lens reflex camera. Furthermore, I can not speak English very well, but he understood it because he spoke slowly and easily. Also, I would like to take part in his tour if I have a chance to go to Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>If you&#8217;re visiting Vancouver, booking an experience with Nafees is a must. This was my second time doing a tour and he was knowledgeable, passionate, and ensured we were safe on our hike. Will be back for the rest of them!<br /><br />
      <li>As advertised! Had a nice time, beautiful and picturesque area! Nafees was so nice and welcoming, and a great teacher! Learned some fun new tips for taking pics in my iPhone!<br /><br />
      <li>It was a great experience. It was a wonderful day at the Lynn Canyon Park because of you and all your knowledge. Thanks 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>We spent a few hours walking around the beautiful Lynn canyon and Nafees showed me lots of techniques to take good photos &#8211; very helpful and interesting.<br /><br />
      <li>Photographs came out very well. Enjoyed hike.<br /><br />
      <li>I was very lucky to be the only person on this trip with Nafees to Lynn Canyon and I cannot speak highly enough of Nafees and his great personal and photography skills. A very relaxed and friendly guy who taught me some useful skills and was very happy to offer helpful advice on my photography as well as my trip around the rest of BC. My time went very quickly. Not much walking involved and took some good photos of the river, glacial swimming hole and the trees of course. We focused more on making use of the light thru the trees and the importance of framing your photos. Thanks so much Nafees for a really enjoyable day and for all of your helpful advice for the rest of my trip!<br /><br />
      <li>Had a wonderful evening @ Lynn Canyon thanks to Nafees. We were able to enjoy the park and learn some info and history. And as if that weren&#8217;t enough, he spent time teaching all of us to feel comfortable with settings on our cameras other than auto. We all came with different levels of experience and different cameras, but he left us all feeling that we could navigate through the various settings..bye bye auto&#8230; What a great evening!<br /><br />
      <li>This walking photo tour is casual and relaxed and will make anyone comfortable with their camera. He has knowledge of whatever camera you bring that quickly allows you to set the camera up for amazing photos. Don’t worry about the weather, he will show you how to get close-ups, portraits, landscapes, and special effects that will be the talk of the town. Well worth the cost. Big Bang for the buck.<br /><br />
      <li>I am very happy that I decided on joining the excursion to Mt. Seymour with Nafees. It was a very spontaneous decision however Nafees was very welcoming. It is a lovely trip having the opportunity to take a lot of pictures. The timing was perfect in the afternoon/evening. Nafees was a great guide who had so many and valuable hints and tricks for my new camera. I would love to join again! I definitely recommend this excursion!<br /><br />
      <li>Great day out with Nafees. I got to learn more about my new DSLR and how to shoot in Manual mode as opposed to Auto and Aperture priority mode and saw beautiful scenery and flora along the way.<br /><br />
      <li>A great experience. Nafees has shown us really beautiful places that are not teeming with tourists. He explained to me how to adjust my automatic camera to get the most out of the photos. He has always taken to explain the camera settings. A very nice tour.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees certainly has a passion for hikes, photography and welcoming guests to the area. Meeting up, transportation, the whole tour was all set up with efficiency while conversing in a friendly manner throughout. Definitely recommend!!<br /><br />
      <li>Excellent hiking experience, above and beyond my expectations. Nafees is an exceptional guide and photographer. He is a knowledgeable, easy going person. Highly recommend him.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a great experience. Nafees was excellent with tips &amp; tricks to hiking and photography. I would highly recommend this experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Guys. Let’s be honest with each other. I had absolutely zero business being on this trail. When people from British Columbia indicate that a trail is “intermediate,” please remember that they are gazelles. The fact that I got safely up and down is solely due to Nafees’ skill as a guide. He is amazing and kind. Despite all of my clonking around, this was still somehow fun. On top of this — he is an amazing (antelope-eyed?) photographer. If you have the chance to participate in this or in one of his other experiences you won’t regret it.<br /><br />
      <li>The hike with Nafees was great, he knew the place very well and he&#8217;s super friendly. The hike is demanding because there are many steps to climb, so you have to be physically fit. The view at the top is amazing and Nafees is a super good photographer. He gives lots of tips to get the best pictures. I recommend this experience, you will love it.<br /><br />
      <li>This was an awesome experience. We had little knowledge of picture taking but Nafees made the experience worth our trip. His one on one training with the camera helped so much. His insight into the history of the Lynn Canyon was fascinating. Overall wonderful experience.<br /><br />
      <li>We had a great time. Nafees made sure all levels were taught something new. We had enough time to explore on our own. My 18 year old appreciates the freedom.<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience, Nafees was knowledgeable, friendly and gave some great tips for capturing the best photos. Thank you.<br /><br />
      <li>Learned a lot about setting on my camera phone! It was a beautiful hike with a great view!<br /><br />
      <li>Thanks Nash for a great day. The weather did help, lots of sunshine, beautiful scenery and a great coach.<br /><br />
      <li>This is a fantastic experience! Nafees is so friendly and knowledgeable, I learned so much about photography which I can’t wait to try out again. The location is amazing and it’s great to get somewhere out of downtown Vancouver where you might not venture by yourself. Highly recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is fantastic! We had such an enjoyable day with him. I had a DSLR and my friend had her iPhone and Nash was great moving back and forth between us to offer suggestions and tips. We weren&#8217;t rushed and didn&#8217;t feel any pressure or stress in using our cameras. Nash was so relaxed and so were we. We had some awesome views and lots of laughs. I highly recommend his tours to any level of photographer and even if you&#8217;re not into photography, just enjoy the amazing vistas and the nature walk. Also, don&#8217;t be deterred by less than perfect weather, as Nash shows you how to make adjustments and still capture the majesty of the scenery around you. I just need to figure out an excuse to get out to Vancouver to take another tour with him!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great host! He knows a lot of the region and taught me a lot of the parts around Vancouver. The hike was in a great location, with 2-3 buses from where we meet up. The view at the top justified the hike and we got to see a lot of region. Nafees also took pictures of me at the various points with his professional camera. He also showcased his knowledge with photography and taught me new tricks with the camera. Overall, it was great to learn more about the Vancouver region and hike the mountain. I would recommend the trip if you&#8217;re getting into photography and want to explore the greater Vancouver region at a more personal level.<br /><br />
      <li>I can&#8217;t recommend this experience enough. Nafees was a wealth of information, both related to Vancouver and photography, and gave us the most memorable day. We&#8217;re so grateful for his time and for making our trip to Vancouver even more special. If you&#8217;re on the fence, trust me: you won&#8217;t regret booking this experience.<br /><br />
      <li>I very nearly cancelled this experience as my luggage disappeared in transit. I wasn’t dressed appropriately, I had a ridiculous pair of shoes on and my camera was also in my missing suitcase. I’m so pleased that I didn’t cancel, Nafees bought along an SLR for me, but I actually had Nafees teach me how to take lovely images using my iPhone. I gained so much while taking in the gorgeous canyon and Nafees has a wealth of knowledge about Vancouver and the surrounding areas.<br /><br />
      <li>A beautiful hike up Stawamus Chief’s Rock. Nafees was a great guide and spent time reminding me how to get off manual mode on a digital camera. I would highly recommend this tour.<br /><br />
      <li>Had an amazing experience! Very cool spots and an even more knowledgeable guide.<br /><br />
      <li>Awesome experience would highly recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a very sympathetic person and was very present and caring. He has good photography knowledge and could easily teach me basic skills.<br /><br />

I highly recommend that everyone try this experience.<br /><br />

      <li>I really enjoyed this experience. I learned more about photography and got to experience a super beautiful hike and waterfall. I would definitely recommend this.<br /><br />
      <li>The hike was really fun to have a tour guide (Nash) who also taught me about my Google Pixel phone to take better pictures. We ended up going on Victoria Day (Canada holiday) which was not too bad for crowd. It was gloomy and raining, but once under the trees, it was a nice day! We got tons of wonderful photos together as well as ones that Nash sent us to cherish. I would recommend this tour to those who are just arriving in Vancouver for the first time to learn more about the area as well as get those lovely photos to share.<br /><br />
      <li>This is a great guided hiking experience. Nafees is an amazing guide and is very warm and welcoming. The hike itself is gorgeous as the forest is a very soothing place. The hike leads to quarry rock, a beautiful viewpoint overlooking the water and islands below. Nafees has great tips on how to shoot good photos and is very knowledgeable about the history of the surrounding environment. I would definitely recommend this to visitors.<br /><br />
      <li>This was a truly incredible day with Nafees! My daughter and I felt very comfortable with him. He is a very genuine person and we felt like we were hanging out with family. His knowledge was top notch and he was good at explaining what we needed to know. We had a lot of laughs and he didn’t rush any part of this tour, it was a most relaxing and wonderful day! Would come over and over again.<br /><br />

      <li>Nafees is a great guide &#8211; very knowledgeable and chatty. I was hoping to do more intensive hiking while in Vancouver but unfortunately had a cold. However, this hike was no more than a couple of hours and not too steep which was ideal for me.

I really appreciate how he taught the basics of photography without getting too technical. He did a great job of tailoring the day to the specific needs/wants of the members of the group.

      <li>We were lucky enough to be the only two for the hike that day and it was definitely worth it. Nafees KNEW Vancouver and the what it has to offer. I never really knew why my photos never captured the beautiful scenery the way I saw it- I read, I watched videos- but having Nafees and his in-depth knowledge there as you are taking a photo was something special.

It was easy to meet everyone at Starbucks and to commute to/from the park. As others have mentioned, Nafees is a friendly host and was easy to communicate with. He was also well knowledgeable about photography, etc! Lynn park is gorgeous and the suspension bridge was not crowded at all. While journeying through the park, we were able to take several pics and to have our pictures taken by Nafees. Throughout the tour, he gave us pointers on how to improve our photography shots. Overall, I enjoyed this experience and I think you will too if you love taking photos, nature, and interacting with new people.

      <li>Nafees&#8217; passion for photography and Vancouver clearly showed in this experience. We had a wonderful time exploring the different areas of Stanley Park and English Bay. Nafees helped capture amazing pictures on both our smartphones and his camera. He taught us different tricks on how to use a smartphone camera to capture unbelievable photos. He patiently answered all our questions and was a lot of fun to hang out with. We were very glad to have started our Vancouver trip with this experience. Highly highly recommended.<br /><br />
      <li>The instructor is very friendly and knowledgeable about photography as well as the location. I got answers to all my questions and I liked that I get to learn a bit about the history of the areas where we shot. This is the second experience I took with Nafees, and I highly recommend them to anyone wanting to learn how to take better photos.<br /><br />
      <li>If you are wanting to explore Bowen Island and take advantage of experienced photography Guide Nash it the person you will want to book with. His genuine passion for hiking and photography will have you in the best places for landscape compositions. He is able to catering to all photography skill levels. I had the pleasure of doing Bowen Island and Mount Seymour day Photography tours with Nash and loved both days and had amazing images. His organisation and communication is faultless, the tours are fun and offer local knowledge and fantastic photography locations. Thank you Nash easy going personality and a fun two days. Highly recommend.<br /><br />
      <li>I would highly recommend the Gas Town/China Town night photography tour. Nafees was a great host and knowledgeable of the area. I wouldn’t be a newcomer to photography, but Nafees provided me some great tips and tricks I’ll try going forward. He also is a great person to chat with over two hours. I felt we got to know each other pretty well and shared some good stories. You can’t argue with the price!<br /><br />
      <li>This was such a great experience, and Nafees was an exceptional host. He is patient and a very good teacher, and helped me understand the photography techniques behind taking pictures at night. It was great to be able to practice and get his immediate feedback. Seeing Gastown at night with Nafees was fun and a real treat. I very much hope I have an opportunity to take more of his photo tours.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees&#8217; tour is one of a kind. He’s a great teacher and made a great travel friend for a day as I followed him in Lyn Canyon and Stanley Park. He knew all the spots to take photos and catered towards my desire for wildlife photos. Made my Vancouver visit truly memorable!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was an excellent guide who put together a great trip. Thoughtful and fun. He also helped me greatly improve my photography skills. I highly recommend him for any tours.<br /><br />
      <li>My family and I had a wonderful time with this walking/photography tour. Nafees shared his photography tips openly and kept us engaged with our surroundings during the three hour walk. Would highly recommend this Airbnb experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Really enjoy the trip. Nafees is so friendly and kind. He explains alot of things about the places we went to and also ways in using the right technique in order to get the best and precise shot. And I’m so happy that I can get a nice photos of myself too!<br /><br />
      <li>Such a great tour. My kids are really into photography and learned a lot from Nafees.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was really nice and taught us useful photography techniques!<br /><br />
      <li>I like that I learned about basic night photography as well as some history about Gastown and the area near it. Nafees shows his enthusiasm and expertise on photography all the time. I was 10 minutes late for the session and Nafees was considerate about it 🙂 This experience taught me a lot that I booked Nafees&#8217; other photography class immediately after.<br /><br />
      <li>It was a great experience and Nafees knows the best way to avoid the crowds. It’s a beautiful hike that’s not too long but very beautiful and has lot of opportunities for great photos. He helped everyone of different skill levels to get the best shots.<br /><br />
      <li>This is a great little tour out to the locals spot of Lynn Canyon. Nafees knows where to get the best shots and gives great advice. It was great to get off the beaten track and see this unique forest not too far from downtown Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>Lynn Canyon Park was amazing and we could have not done this without the help of Nafees. Commuting via bus was a different experience. We started late due to unexpected circumstances, otherwise we had a great time and we were able to capture beautiful pictures!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is great! My boys (age 13 &amp; 10) really appreciated and enjoyed his photography lesson. This experience was the best experience during our Vancouver trip.<br /><br />
      <li>I had an incredible time and will always remember it! Lynn Canyon is an amazing place! Nafees is really knowledgeable and you will learn a lot with him 🙂 I highly recommend it, you won’t be disappointed!<br /><br />
      <li>Really great experience! Nafees helped me get some really good shots!<br /><br />
      <li>Highly recommend this experience, to the extent that I am doing other experiences with Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>Night photography with Nafees was fantastic. My son is getting into photography and was starting from scratch with a DSLR. Nafees guided him in the basics of photography while helping him understand how to use the features of his camera. Throughout the night, Nafees helped us understand the different parts of downtown Vancouver, why he chose them for night photography, and how to use our own equipment (DSLR for my son, phone cameras for my daughter and me) to get the best shots. It was a great experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Very good experience, not only learned some shooting skills, met another cute little friend, the organizer also shared some local cultural stories, the experience is unforgettable, very nice!<br /><br />
      <li>My experience with Nafees was incredible! We walked around Stanley Park and he took as many pictures of me as I wanted! We had a great conversation and I feel like I made a new friend with him and the others in the group. Thank you, Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>My son and I had a wonderful time with Nafees, he showed us around Stanley park and he showed us how take professional photos with our smartphone and also showed us some cool tips and tricks with the camera. Enjoyed the whole experience overall,would recommend this to everyone.<br /><br />
      <li>Great guy. Easy to talk to and made it lots of fun to walk around. Definitely a funny guy! Enjoyed the whole thing and would do it again.<br /><br />
      <li>This experience was very cool! Nafees was professional and very knowledgeable about his work! Really enjoyed my time in this beautiful environment!!<br /><br />
      <li>Amazing tour guide and wonderful experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Do it!<br /><br />
      <li>I highly recommend this if you don&#8217;t have night plans or can&#8217;t figure out what to do. Being a very amateur photographer myself, night photography has always been something I&#8217;ve wanted to try but never had the confidence to do. My friend and I felt completely safe walking around niche parts of town with Nafees and he not only showed us great areas for pictures, but took and shared pictures of us in action as well and it made our trip all the more memorable. I also got to learn a lot about adjusting the fstop, iso, etc. and got to try my new prime lens out on this trip and it made for some really cool pictures, especially with long exposure. I highly recommend this, even if you don&#8217;t have a dslr and just have a smartphone, he caters to your needs/skill level well!<br /><br />
      <li>Our experience with Nafees was top-notch! My husband and I truly enjoyed exploring the nature of Vancouver with Nafees. We got some AMAZING photos and learned so many great things about this city and it’s people. Would highly recommend this experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is passionate and knowledgeable person. I was truly happy to be coming his guest!<br /><br />
      <li>I genuinely had an amazing time with Nafees. I was the only guest to attend during my trip so it felt special because of the one on one interaction. The scenery is gorgeous and I came right in time for snow fall which made pictures 10x better (March 11). I will say, if you&#8217;re not use to hiking, this trail isn&#8217;t that easy for most. But, give this experience a shot and you won&#8217;t regret it.<br /><br />
      <li>I had always been quite uneasy and diffident taking night photographs. Nafees introduced us with how to control the light and depth of fields by manually adjusting the shutter speed and aperture, very important aspects of night photography. He took us for the actual photo walk after the brief and allowed us to take photos, gave feedback on them and also took some great photographs of us. He also taught us some other photography techniques which are difficult to explain in words. The night photography walk was totally worth it.<br /><br />
      <li>So glad that I decided to book this experience. Nafees is a really cool and down to earth guy and I enjoyed the hike and photography lesson with him today. He&#8217;s funny, well traveled, and easy to relate to. He knows the trail well and I learned how to take much better pictures on my travels. I highly suggest booking this tour if you&#8217;re considering it, trust!<br /><br />
      <li>Vancouver gas town is a great place to take night photography &#8211; and Nafees gives all sorts of tips to take beautiful pictures during night time! I genuinely enjoyed the experience. It&#8217;s still bit cold at night so I recommend to be prepared for it!<br /><br />
      <li>Awesome way to experience this hike! Some beautiful memories captured!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a passionate host that has an incredible understanding of the history of Vancouver. More important for me personally was his profound knowledge of photography. Nafees knows how to operate under any type of lighting. He’s also more than happy to work with you on photography tips no matter your skill level or camera (I had an iPhone). If you have the chance over the course of a few days, sign up for all three of his tours (Stanley park, Gastown &amp; Chinatown Night Photography and Lynn Canyon). The pictures came out incredible and Nafees was able to send the pictures promptly. I’d recommend doing all three tours but space them out because there’s a decent amount of walking. Incredible tour.<br /><br />
      <li>This was the third tour I did with Nafees, and possibly my favorite. Stanley Park is gorgeous and Nafees&#8217; tour during the golden hour yielded some amazing photographs. Highly recommended.<br /><br />
      <li>This was the perfect hiking experience! Very scenic, not too long/difficult, and Nafees was really great. He&#8217;s extremely knowledgeable and I enjoyed hearing all of his stories and picking his brain about Vancouver. He also gave really helpful photography tips &amp; stopped at a bunch of good photo spots along the way and shares pictures with you later. It was 100% worth it &amp; I highly recommend it!<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience! We got to check out quiet and unexplored places in Lynn Canyon, practice foundational photo techniques, and get great photos!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was an awesome guide and knowledgeable about photography. I liked him so much I signed up for his Stanley Park tour as well.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is so personable and knows a lot about shooting photography. He’s patient and encouraging. Glad to meet him.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was patient and helpful. He helped ensure each person left with great photos. Lynn Canyon was beautiful and the hike was an overall great experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is great, and the park is amazingly beautiful 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is one of the most genuine guides I’ve ever met. He makes you feel like a friend right away. Nafees made sure everyone felt safe, and went at a secure pace as it snowed the night before. He took many photos with my own device as well as his camera (to share later). I am very glad I got to experience this and will recommend to any friend that will be visiting Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>It was definitely one of the highlights of my visit here in Vancouver. I had a great time exploring many unique areas and overall an amazing experience. Would love to do it again.<br /><br />
      <li>Awesome experience! Awesome views and great experience for everyone.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a great moment suspended in time. The place is magical, Nafees puts in confidence, he is attentive, knows the place very well. Communication was easy. I recommend with eyes closed!<br /><br />
      <li>What a magical awe inspiring experience. I’m beyond grateful I got to play in the snow and experience the beauty of nature with Nafees and through his lens (pun intended). Thank you for being an excellent guide. I hope to return to Lynn Canyon again!<br /><br />
      <li>Had a great experience hiking Lynn Canyon with Nafees and the rest of our group. Great tour guide with knowledge to access to some parts of the canyon only locals like him would know and happy to take you there for you to see, really good photo scenery. Also very good knowledge of professional cameras and advice for settings outside the &#8220;auto&#8221; mode for an amateur like me to take very decent pictures, that was a plus. Will definitely do another tour with Nafees another time when I return to Vancouver.It was a great experience, the place is really beautiful if you like nature. Nafees showed me how to use my cell phone camera and was always attentive and worried about my safety since it had been snowed and there were areas that could be slippery. I definitely recommend this experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Very nice tour. trails are great. Can’t really see the mountains and cities due to fog. But i still had a great time walking with Nafees! And the trails aren’t long and the whole trip is quite relaxing. Also Nafees take photos very well! Recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>I am very new to photography and Nafees was super helpful and patient with teaching me how to work my camera and take amazing photos! Was a really great experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Took really stunning photos!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is personable, and well informed. I felt instantly comfortable with him as we wandered around taking a range of shots with different techniques. Had a great time. Recommend gloves for wintertime!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was super nice and accommodating ! He catered the tour as per my wishes and what he though would work best for me ! I definitely learnt photography techniques from him and he took some great photographs of me 🙂 was a great experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Definitely recommend this experience! Nafees was an excellent guide we learned about photo techniques and he made the experience very easy!! Highlight of our trip by far!<br /><br />
      <li>I’m an amateur when it comes to photography and Nafees was able to teach me numerous tips and tricks not just for shooting landscape photography but things that will help me take all of my photos to the next level. The hike in and out of Lynn Canyon can be accomplished by those with little to no prior hiking experience (though proper footwear and clothing is a must) but will still satisfy seasoned outdoor enthusiasts with its incredible fauna, waterfalls, and views from the suspension bridge. Nafees is very kind and personable, so much so that I walked away feeling like I had taken a stroll through the forest with old friends, when we had only met less than two hours before. If you are a photographer of any ability who is interested in capturing some unique photos and enjoying a beautiful coastal rainforest, look no further! This experience checks all the boxes.<br /><br />
      <li>Amazing experience! I had done snowshoeing before, and I loved it, but this tour is definitely something unique! Nash was an amazing guide! I definitely recommend this tour, but you should be prepared for a good work out (nothing extreme, but you do walk around 5 kms with the snowshoes that are a bit heavy, and your jacket, and everything else). The views and the overall experience are definitely worth it!<br /><br />
      <li>We loved our hiking and photography experience with Nafees! It was the perfect opportunity to explore a part of Vancouver we had not seen before, with some even better company! He is very personable and easy to talk to, and makes the experience worthwhile. We would highly recommend this experience to anyone!<br /><br />
      <li>Awesome, insightful, and well knowledgeable. someone that is down to earth, I would recommend him to my friends and family.<br /><br />
      <li>Beautiful tour at Alexander Falls Absolutely amazing first part. My first time on snow-shoes, and that went well for the first part. In the second part, more experience would have been nice. That part was not for all.<br /><br />
      <li>Great hike<br /><br />
      <li>I loved my previous experience with Nafees so much (Lynn Canyon), that I decided to book with him again! It can be pretty daunting to do night photography at first, but Nafees teaches you some really helpful tips! He took me on a mini tour of Gastown along the way and was full of knowledge about the area. It honestly felt like I was hanging out with a friend more than anything else. His easygoing and friendly nature makes him so easy to be around. I would highly recommend any of his trips! 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was great! He made our experience super fun and educational. He went over specific concepts of basic photography during different parts of the hike and used our surroundings for examples. Lynn Canyon was absolutely beautiful and it was great having someone know the lay of the land. He gave us great tips for places to visit in the city. He was very kind and knowledgeable.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a very personable, intelligent, and hilarious individual! I enjoyed his teaching style, and found that he was able to explain difficult concepts in an easy manner. He was also very patient and supportive of everyone&#8217;s learning needs. In terms of the scenery, Lynn Canyon was perfect! The suspension bridge, greenery, and river combined made for some amazing shots. I feel as though I learned so much in such a short time span. Thank you Nafees for such a great experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees took me around all the cool spots in Gastown, Chinatown and Canada Place for this evening photography tour. He showed me how to capture the best photos in these areas and gave me some great tips on night photography. Very friendly, polite and talented guy, definitely recommend if you&#8217;re looking for something to do with your evenings downtown!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees knows local secrets that even a local like myself wouldn&#8217;t know. Went to Lynn Canyon tour with him and was surprised to learn about the Twin falls bridge, despite having visited that park myself several times. He teaches photography tips, regardless if you&#8217;re a smartphone novice or an experienced DSLR user. I&#8217;ve been on many previous tours with Nature Photohikes since 2015 and the trips are always bound to leave you with many Instagram-worthy moments.<br /><br />
      <li>Such an amazing experience! Nafees was an excellent guide and made the experience worth while. Definitely recommend if you’re traveling and would like someone who knows the area. So glad that I booked snowshoeing and have excellent pictures to capture my trip! He was awesome and helping capture the moment!<br /><br />
      <li>This was my first ever AirBnb experience and I can’t say enough great things about it!!! Nafees was amazing, informative and friendly and welcoming. The entire group was so wonderful, it was a great afternoon. I highly recommend booking a tour with Nafees, you won’t regret it!<br /><br />
      <li>Beautiful hiking in an area that is off the main tourist track.<br /><br />
      <li>The guide has good experience for enjoying beautiful views. It is a good experience. There is some hide place that this person can lead you in!<br /><br />
      <li>Highly recommended!! Experienced, friendly, patient &#8211; Nash was very friendly and extremely accommodating for our family (2 adults and 2 kids) of beginner snowshoers. He was patient with our constant stops and his experience helped us in areas of difficult terrain. Highly recommended. We’d love to come back to conquer Garibaldi lake with you.<br /><br />
      <li>It was a beautiful experience. After the trip with Nafees, I feel like I am a professional photographer. I would recommend all the tourist to try this small tour with Nafees and learn a lot about Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>Amazing tour guide! Very knowledgeable about photography and the city. Took us to beautiful locations to take pictures! Would definitely recommend this tour to everyone!<br /><br />
      <li>I loved it. best hike ever and took some amazing shots just with my phone!<br /><br />
      <li>Trip of a lifetime: I didn’t realise what a joy a nature photography tour is until I took this with my adult son who also loves photography. Nash was the perfect and kind navigator thru the forest. Forest-bathing detox and fitness benefits, treasure hunting in nature, the best Eggs Benedict on this charming island. Near enough to the city but totally a different world!<br /><br />
      <li>Very pretty hike and learned some new tricks with my iPhone camera for the best photos.<br /><br />
      <li>If you wanna feel nature in Vancouver, I’ll definitely recommend you to go this hiking. He knows a lot of things about Lynne Canyon. He also told me about camera.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is very kind and it is amazing trip. Very recommendable. He showed me his camera skills very kindly and added some fun and excitement with his special trails and routes. It has become a very precious Christmas.<br /><br />
      <li>Awesome!! It was my first experience of snowshoeing and I enjoyed alot. Thanks to Nafees for taking cool pictures.<br /><br />
      <li>Amazing hike tour 🙂 This was a great hiking tour at Lynn Canyon. Nafees is knowledgeable about the area, he is kind and very helpful to show how to capture good picture with great techniques. Highly recommended for solo, couples or family travellers with Nafees.<br /><br />
      <li>The hiking was amazing! And Nafees is extremely friendly and an amazing guide!<br /><br />
      <li>I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect with this excursion but I&#8217;m so glad I went! Nafees was an amazing tour guide he was fun to talk to and gave me lots of info to side me in my Vancouver trip. His knowledge of the area and of photography helped make the experience unforgettable me. I recommend this to anyone who wants to see the beauty Vancouver has to offer.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is very knowledgeable and I immensely enjoyed my experience. If you are looking for a nice hike with lots of beautiful photo opportunities, I highly recommend you check this out.<br /><br />
      <li>Was a gorgeous tour, and he was very helpful with using your camera the right way and he definitely knew the area.<br /><br />
      <li>I cannot say enough about the positive experience we just had with Nash at Nature PhotoHikes. From ease of rescheduling (due to an airline travel delay) to the perfect balance of guidance and time to explore on our own, he was an ideal guide. He even got my 15-year old daughter, who &#8220;knows everything&#8221; she needs to know about photography to listen and learn a few new tricks. The photos we walked away with were astoundingly beautiful and balanced, owing partly to the beauty of Lynn Canyon, which was a perfect hike for us. I highly recommend this organization and look forward to another hike in the near future.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a great guide through Lynn Canyon. The scenery was beautiful and I left with some amazing pictures. This was a highlight of my weekend in Vancouver and I would highly recommend to others visiting the area.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a really great time hiking through the Lynn Canyon with Nafees, and took some really lovely photos. Nafees was really friendly and knowledgeable, both about photography and everything related to Vancouver. I would definitely recommend this experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a great guide to the Lynn Canyon and was very helpful with all manner of photography questions. He ensured we arrived safely, stayed safe while he taught some tricks of photography and got us back to town. It was a great area to hike around and even my parents, who didn&#8217;t do any photography, were happy to be out exploring nature. It was a wonderful trip and even came with some tips for Chinatown (where we got dropped off after the hike).<br /><br />
      <li>It was really easy to meet and get there (Nafees took us by public bus). It’s a lovely part of Vancouver, easy walking options, great views. Nafees knows a lot about the area, showed us some off-trail spots for some nice shots. He gave us some great photography tips, and we had a good time. We need to go back!<br /><br />
      <li>The park is beautiful and Nafees is an excellent and patient guide. In a few minutes I learned more from him about outdoor photography than I had gleaned from several books! He was wonderful with the whole family as well.<br /><br />
      <li>Had a great time hiking in Lynn park. Would like to do that again. Forest was amazing and I enjoyed the conversation with Nafees very much ~he is knowledgeable and fun to hang around with. It’s definitely one of the experiences you would not want to miss in Vancouver ~Highly recommended.<br /><br />
      <li>From the get-go, Nafees was super energetic and happy to show us around the city of Vancouver. Being that he grew up in the city, he was more than happy to give up tips on how to get around the city and what other sights to see. He was everything I wanted in a tour guide — patient, knowledgeable, and hilarious! He was also there to take pictures when my now-fiancé proposed on the suspension bridge ❤️❤️ that is a memory that we will remember forever, and we cannot thank him enough for that!<br /><br />
      <li>Simple experience, but absolutely satisfying! The bridge and the park are very beautiful and definitely less crowded than the more touristy (and expensive) Capilano Suspension Bridge. Nafees is a great guide, passionate and helpful, he gave me a lot of advice on how to take better pictures and he also offered to accompany me on the beach, after the excursion to the park, to photograph the sunset. All in all definitely recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was very friendly and polite. He is a fine photographer and takes time to teach you the finetuning of your camera. he knows his way around and is happy to share his knowings and his friendship.<br /><br />
      <li>I did Quarry rock and Lynn Canyon full day trip. Nash was great! He had great tips and the photographs looked awesome. He picked me up from my stay as I was the only one on the hike and was courteous and accommodating.<br /><br />
      <li>I booked the full-day Vancouver sightseeing and photography tour in late October and had a fantastic day out. Nash, my guide and photography teacher, took me to all the major sights worth seeing around Vancouver at a really great pace that was enjoyable with plenty of time for questions, chit chat and photography tips. Nash is a really talented photographer and a great teacher, as well as a knowledgeable local. I highly recommend this tour! I felt it was great value for money and I&#8217;ve come away with fantastic photos to remember my time in Vancouver!<br /><br />
      <li>At One with Nature and Breathtaking Scenery to Photograph &#8211; A sensational tour with Nash,(we almost missed the bus!!) Our memories are still very fresh in our minds of our first experience of walking in the lush forest with Squamish down below. The morning was a little foggy and cool, but that makes for even better photography. Then the sun came out in the afternoon, highlighting the snow-capped mountains. Just awesome! Nash had great stories and we swapped many of those while on our walk. His assistance with camera settings and positioning shots carefully, really made a difference to the quality of my photography memories. Nash&#8217;s friendly and easy going manner made our first trip in Canada truly an event not to miss, we are so wonderfully pleased that we booked this event. The glorious part was that there was hardly anyone else on our walking trail! Extraordinary! Thank you Nash for the laughs!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees, my guide, took me to some really great, low-travelled places on our hike. He knows all the highlights, what times are best for light/photographs, how to avoid the crowds, and how to help me with my camera. We also went to three or four off the beaten path locations for some amazing shots of water falls and streams. I bought a 4 hour tour, and while Nafees offers longer (and shorter) ones, it was the perfect amount of time and pace for my short vacation.<br /><br />
      <li>I think you may be selling yourself short online! I had an amazing time today and I never would’ve guessed that I was going to have such a stellar time. I appreciate the friendly conversation and getting to know you and your life in Vancouver (and abroad). Thank you so much for sharing your time with me and offering this really fun service. Things like this typically go really great or really bad and you have the perfect personality for this job and amazing skills to teach. Thank you again.<br /><br />
      <li>I visited Vancouver on vacations, looking for some adventures. I did some hikes around the city, but even before coming I had Nafees photo tours in my sight. He normally doesn&#8217;t do hikes to Joffre this late in the year, but we were lucky the weather was good, and he was nice to accommodate me and other two hikers when the day allowed it. He even got to plan around and pick me up from my hotel at Whistler! Overall, Nafees is a great guide, not only very knowledgeable, but also very friendly and with a lot of stories to tell! The views at Joffre are stunning, and he knows the best spots to take photos, even as to taking photos himself and sharing them with the group. As a solo traveler, this was definitely the highlight of my adventure at Vancouver. Totally recommended. I may find myself returning next year for some winter hikes!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was an excellent guide and had great tips about both hiking in Vancouver and photography! would recommend this tour to anyone and everyone sure to have an amazing time!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is amazing! He’ll tell you insider photography secrets, knows the lay of the land, is friendly, knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I couldn’t have asked for a better tour guide for this excursion and experiencing this portion of Vancouver. Highly rated! Thanks again Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>What an unforgettable experience! Nafees is super friendly and patient, one of the best host I&#8217;ve ever met. Not to mention funny! Very knowledgeable and showed us some really cool spots we probably wouldn&#8217;t have found otherwise. He pointed out things that caught his eye as a photographer and showed us how to capture the best shot of nature. Great opportunity to take some awsome photos. I&#8217;ve learned so much from him. Such a nice teacher! The tour is very complete, I would highly recommend it! Thanks a lot, Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was excellent! So patient and knowledgeable! He not only shared tidbits of interesting information about Vancouver, but also GREATLY helped me to use my Canon Rebel T3i! It was the perfect photography lesson in a beautiful setting! So glad we found this awesome excursion!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was attentive, knowledgable and amiable. Lynn Canyon is beautiful and the combination of Nafees&#8217; knowledge and the beautiful surroundings made for an exceptional experience. Highly recommended! 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees has yet again one-upped himself by thoughtfully and meticulously planning every adventure during the 4 nights at Whitehorse. These included, dog-sledding, hot-springs, and of course, the lights! While the Airbnb hosts were very warm and welcoming, we were limited to only one usable washroom among the nine (or so) of us, which was the only let down. However this didn&#8217;t dampen the fabulous experience I had with Nafees and the group. The views of the city and the Yukon landscape from the mountain we hiked were breathtaking. The book stores and coffee shops made walking along the snow covered roads enjoyable. Overall, the company of other (group) members, beautiful views, delicious food (bison burgers are delicious) and Nafees&#8217; well planned itinerary, made this trip one of many memorable &#8220;Nature Photo Hikes adventures&#8221; 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>I was in Vancouver for a few days to run the Seawheeze Half Marathon and stumbled across Nature Photo Hikes while researching hikes in the area. Being a solo traveler I thought it might be safer to book a trip with a group than venture out alone. I am so glad I did! It ended up being the highlight of my trip. Nafees is knowledgeable and helpful and I enjoyed the cultural variety of the group I was with. And the hike is absolutely stunning. It ended up being a cloudy day so unfortunately we did not get the view we hoped for from atop Panorama Ridge, but Nafees was awesome enough to escort myself and one other girl in our group to Lake Garibaldi by another route so we could enjoy its beauty up close. Be warned: the hike to Panorama Ridge is not a walk in the park. The first 4-5 miles are all switchbacks and the tough ascent to the ridge would likely be challenging for inexperienced hikers. I am a runner and avid hiker so I luckily did not struggle but just something to consider before embarking on this journey. But no matter what level you are &#8211; if you are looking for an experienced, kind, knowledgeable guide, I highly recommend you book with Nafees and his team! Cant wait to book another hike on my next trip to the area!<br /><br />
      <li>My experience with Nafees was wonderful. Nafees is very knowledgeable about the trials and hike around Vancouver and provides plenty of education. I was a solo traveler and he helped me so much not only discovering the full potential of my camera but as well as taking my photos in the hidden location and showing his favourite off the beaten paths. I would highly recommend this if you are thinking to to hike and want to learn a bit more about your camera.<br /><br />
      <li>Being a solo traveler I thought I should try with my gang and the hike was amazing. That enabled us to take pictures and load them to DBGallery which allowed us share the pictures easily without having to worry how to see the different pictures taken by any of us. This experience was not for the faint-hearted, but definitely what I needed as recommenended by my doctor.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a really nice and experience hiker, he took care of the whole group from the last to the first hiker, very experience hiker +50 Garibaldi trails!! For sure I do recommend him, thank you so much Nafees, I hope to see you on the next event. All the best for you!!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is an excellent guide and connoisseur of the natural areas of Vancouver, besides being an incredibly friendly person. During the tour you will take excellent photos in the best places of the forest. Highly recommended, definitely one of the best tours.<br /><br />
      <li>The hike was amazing. We had gorgeous views of rivers and water falls. Nash was an experienced hiker and had wonderful knowledge of where we were. Nash also took photos of us and emailed them to us after the trip. It was a great experience and can’t wait to try another hike with Nash. Highly recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was amazing! Great guide, super friendly, and an amazing photographer. I was a little worried at first as I was the only one on the tour, and going off on a hike with a guy you just met isn’t normally something I would do. But Nafees made me comfortable at once. Really recommend this experience!<br /><br />
      <li>I really enjoyed the hikes as much as I did learning photography in the forest. Nafees is knowledgeable about the area and can help with tips and tricks too. The bridge and hikes were amazing!<br /><br />
      <li>Usually when we travel someplace for three or more days we like to do some trail hiking. Especially something that includes a good workout and some world class scenery. This 15 hour venture absolutely exceeded my expectations.&nbsp;Nafees is a well organized adept that seems to enjoy his job more than most of the people of this world. I am not the only one who picked up on this. Our party of five had two singles who were repeat customers of his tour. That definitely meant a lot to me. While my wife and I thought we were in pretty good shape, it became clear that we were going to be the laggards of our group. It didn’t help that I over-packed. I probably should have packed less stuff but I didn’t want to be caught unprepared in case of a significant weather change. In the end I probably could have left 75% of my back pack contents in the car when it became clear that the weather was going to be nice for the day. Nafees maintained his position at the back of the group and coached us along as we kept a steady, yet rigorous pace.&nbsp;I was thankful that I brought sandals for the decent. I would highly recommend packing a pair for any all day hike. We brought our own lunches. I probably should have brought a flask of whiskey or a bottle of wine. We had a fun group and I think this would have gone over well with our fellow hikers.&nbsp;If you’re into photography I would highly recommend this excursion. There was plenty of expertise offered by Nafees for those wishing to improve their photographic skills.<br /><br />
      <li>My husband signed us up for this hike. I kept asking him why does it take 14 hours? How long will we actually be hiking? It was a very hard 7K going up the mountain, but the view at the top was amazing! We spent a lot of time at the top eating, and taking pictures. Nafeez talked about composition and depth of field and how to adjust things to get just the right picture. We stopped a lot on the way down to take photographs, the lighting was perfect! Nafeez did a great job motivating me to get up the mountain, thank you!<br /><br />
      <li>Extremely organised and friendly tour &#8211; I was originally down to do the Joffre Lakes hike, but due to bad weather on the day, Nash knew from his experience that it would have been a poor experience to continue with that tour. Not to leave me in the lurch with nothing to do for the day, Nash quickly organised an alternate hike to Quarry Rock which is less affected by the weather. Given the price differences in the tour, Nash told me straight up that he would refund me the difference and he processed this change quickly. Quarry Rock was a fantastic hike, giving you an opportunity to experience the beautiful BC forest with a great view at the top. Nash shared lots of photography tips along the way, giving advanced tips to those with DSLR cameras in the group and cool photography techniques to myself rocking the Galaxy S8 as my weapon of choice. On top of this, Nash has a very friendly personality and he is easy to get along with. I&#8217;m very introverted so was a bit anxious about doing the tour, but Nash was great to hang out with and a good source of knowledge for what you can do in the Vancouver area after the tour. I&#8217;ll definitely be booking tours again with Nash next time I&#8217;m in Vancouver, not just because of how much easier it is having a guide for these hikes, but to enjoy the company of Nash and fellow like-minded hikers!<br /><br />
      <li>I learnt so much from Nafees in such a short time! It was eye opening to see what my camera could do in the manual setting. I’m never using automatic settings again lol. He was on time, and easy to talk with. Nafees made the tour informative but also fun. If I’m ever in Vancouver again I would book another tour with him! Definitely worth it!<br /><br />
      <li>Best way how to experience Vancouver &#8211; I did several hikes with him, Garibaldi Lake, Deep Cove, Wedgemount Lake and Stawamus Chief. And I would do more if I had more time!<br /><br />
      <li>This tour was the highlight of Vancouver! We did Capilano earlier in the day but we much preferred Lynn Canyon with Nafees. This off the beaten path tour felt like you were walking trails that the locals walk and if I lived in Vancouver this is the spot I would always go! Nafees was an awesome host, very professional and easy to get on with. I’ve read photography lessons before but being taught first hand by Nafees was invaluable. Thanks for a great afternoon Nafees, I feel like a proper nature photographer now!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great guide, he will help you with taking pictures, entertain you on your way to the top. (and take the best pictures of you). I highly recommend all of his hikes!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a great tour guide and knowledgeable. He took the time to give us tips on how to use our camera&#8217;s and to take a great shots, and to show us where to eat lunch later 🙂 Very friendly and down to earth. The Lynn Canyon Park is awesome, and i think I would done another 4 hours to explore the rest of it. Thank you Nafees<br /><br />
      <li>I&#8217;m not exactly a nature photo enthusiast and only had a camera phone, but I still had a fantastic time and got some great shots. The hike itself was really great (good shoes recommended) and we got to explore hidden streams, bridges and waterfalls. The tour guide also took pictures of us in the beautiful scenery if we wanted, so I also got some nice shots of myself which I appreciate as a solo traveler. Beautiful hiking location!<br /><br />
      <li>It was a great experience in Vancouver. Lynn Canyon is my favorite place in Vancouver currently from Nafees&#8217; tour. It suits well with who love to take a photo with camera or just smartphone. Nafees knows well about Lynn Canyon. He also gave me a good suggestions on other venue in Canada.<br /><br />
      <li>Not for the faint of heart and definitely not easy, this hike was exactly what I needed when I went last week. It was stunningly beautiful and filling up on glacier water was a tremendous perk. All-around, 5 stars for sure. Plus, our guide Nash was very knowledgeable and helpful and the small group atmosphere was fun.<br /><br />
      <li>Excellent natural scenery for pictures: The tour takes you to a forest with incredible natural scenery. They give you helpful tips for taking great pictures.<br /><br />
      <li>Awesome &#8220;insiders&#8221; trip!&nbsp;When we travel, we always try to see a city the way residents do. This beautiful hike helped us do that. We got to hike some beautiful trails without having to navigate how to get there. Nafees was a fun and easy-going guide. We also appreciated not only his photography tips, but also the result of his own, gorgeous efforts behind the camera. We recommend this trip without hesitation!!<br /><br />
      <li>The photography walk was a wonderful experience. I absolutely loved the trail, Nafees was a great guide and very knowledgeable about photography – I took away some really good tips. And his passion for the area is infectious! Highly recommend.<br /><br />
      <li>Charming guy with lots of knowledge, in history geographic and photography. Small group.<br /><br />
      <li>The canyon was beautiful and Nash gave us some amazing tips about how to make the most out the scenery. Extremely friendly and the hike was very easy. I highly recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>Thanks again for what was a very challenging but rewarding experience with some incredible, breathtaking views along the way. I appreciate Nafees being a very kind and supportive hiking guide and for making sure he didn’t just leave us somewhere on the mountain 😉 It wasn’t easy for me or my girlfriend, but we definitely consider the hike easily the highlight of our trip to Vancouver and we are very happy and proud that we did it. Thanks again for the photos. The fourth photo in the collection that has me and Lauren is priceless and I intend on having it printed and framed as a memory I will treasure. Everyone that I have shown that picture to has been blown away. The entire experience was great and it was a pleasure meeting Nafees and getting to know him along the hike.<br /><br />
      <li>This was by far one the best and most informative excursions we’ve ever been on! Nafees was very patient and knowledgeable not only about photography but told us all kinds of interesting facts about Vancouver. He made sure everyone had one on one help including our daughter. My daughter kept saying how fun that trip was and we definitely agree! Thank you Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>My trip with Nafees was great! Very easygoing and gave great tips on basic photography and how to set up shot composition. Along the way, he showed us his favorite photo locations inside the park and gave us plenty of time to hunt for our favorite photo opportunities.<br /><br />
      <li>Had a great time taking photos and admiring the park! Nafees picked us up at the bus stop close to us and we took buses there, which was a nice way to experience the local’s way. He taught me a lot about how to use a digital camera and how to take nice pictures! The hike was beautiful and he was a very nice and cool guide! 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a great guide and photographer. Super attentive and tailored his advice and tips individually to different members of the group depending on their experience. Lake Garibaldi is truly stunning and well worth the hike. Lynn Canyon was also beautiful.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is great! Had a great evening at Lynn Canyon. It was a very relaxing and calm hike. He took photos for all of the group and taught some basic photography skills to me about using a dslr camera.<br /><br />
      <li>I really enjoyed exploring Lynn Canyon with Nafees. Nice easy hike with great stops to snap a good photo or two.<br /><br />
      <li>Really nice walk and learned a lot about landscape photography!!<br /><br />
      <li>I thoroughly enjoyed this experience. The hike in Lynn Canyon was better than I expected. A great setting to learn some new skills in photography. I am so grateful for what Nafees has taught me about using my camera. He was patient and explained everything until I understood what my camera is capable in doing. I’m excited for the new skills I learned and will continue to practice until I get those perfect shots! Finally a hands on experience I needed to learn. You’re a great teacher, Nafees! Glad to have met you!<br /><br />
      <li>Super thoughtful, thorough and kind! Great tour guide with excellent instruction on how to use light and SLR cameras. I feel like I learned a lot in a hands on environment.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is an expert in nature and photography in Vancouver. He knows how to lead people in the crowded park. He will take you to great spots that which are hidden beauties but not crowded areas, so that you can learn how to take nice nature photos and videos with functions like use of lights and contrast, depth and amount of exposure. I could actually take nicer photos for my camera. Plus he will take photos of you in the breathtaking nature in the park like a personal photographer for you. After his touch for the picture, he will kindly send them to you through a link. He is a passionate and experienced guide. You won’t regret. He was also a good and patient company to talk with through the whole tour. After the tour I felt so thankful to see real beauty of Canada not only just foodie stuff that people can easily do.<br /><br />
      <li>Great tour! Nafees was super friendly and knowledgeable about the area and photography tips.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a wonderful day hiking with Nafees. He showed me how to use my camera and I managed to get some nice shots. He&#8217;s a very knowledgeable guide who makes you feel comfortable right from the start. I highly recommend booking a tour with him!<br /><br />
      <li>Any hike/experience with Nafees is an absolute must! He is an incredible guide, and will go your pace on the hikes. I went with just my iPhone, and learned how to take more professional looking photos. Nafees is not only knowledgeable about the area and photography, but traveling in general!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a great guide and had a lot of great photography tips. This tour is definitely more photography based than just a walking tour. Nafees does bring you all over the park though with different viewpoints of the waterfall and there’s an opportunity, with good weather, to get your feet wet if you want. He also sends you candid and posed pictures he took after too. This tour was the perfect amount of time, wear good walking shoes and be ready for great photo opportunities!<br /><br />
      <li>What an&nbsp;amazing day! Thank you so much! Our guide, Nafees Shams was great in every way. Wonderful tour!<br /><br />

      <li>Completely relaxed trip for a short time out of the city and pure into nature. The trail requires a bit of fitness and good slip resistance. We had really fun and joy, can only recommend this little trip.<br /><br />
      <li>The experience at Squamish was the best ever! The views were unbelievable, out of reality, you have to do it once in a lifetime, its not a piece of cake but it totally worth it! Nafees is also the best guide and photographer ever!! He was an interesting person and he took the most awesome photos! I appreciate the great time at this experience.<br /><br />
      <li>It is an excellent and recommendable experience. Nafees, is an enthusiastic host and knows a lot about photography. It teaches basic and advanced subjects, which can be applied in charming spaces and ideal for photographing.<br /><br />
      <li>It was a nice experience. Nafees is knowledgeable about the place. My family and I felt comfortable and enjoyed every second of it. Totally worth going !<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great person and tour guide! He taught me the basics of photography using my Sonya6000, had great knowledge of the Vancouver area and made the time fly by. I highly recommend his tour if you want to hike in a less crowded area and learn how to create great pictures.<br /><br />
      <li>The experience was great!! I only had my Pixel phone to take the photos with, but Nafees showed me some techniques I can use to take better photos. I&#8217;ve been using what I learned from him on this trip so it was really helpful. In addition to the lessons, the hike itself was really calming with the beautiful scenery. Nafees was also a great conversationalist so it felt really easy to talk to him, as if he&#8217;s an old friend. The photos he took were great too! Thanks again!!<br /><br />
      <li>I really loved how Nafees teaches new techniques with each progress through the hike. I&#8217;ve always found manual mode very daunting but Nafees breaks it down in a digestible manner. In the past I&#8217;ve only taken pictures with my DSLR on trips and occasions (in Auto or picture modes). Now I&#8217;m looking forward to practicing more with the new skills I&#8217;ve learnt. I&#8217;d recommend this as one of your first tours if you&#8217;re visiting Vancouver!<br /><br />
      <li>Really great insight &amp; perspectives. Highly recommend Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was very knowledgeable and gave us some great pointers. After working with him I was immediately able to take better photos and have a much better understanding of how dlsr cameras work. He was also extremely personable and fun to be around, and had plenty of info to share about the city. I felt like I was walking around the forest hiking with a friend. I&#8217;d highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to really capture those &#8220;Instagram photos&#8221;<br /><br />
      <li>I had a great afternoon with Nafees, Lynn Canyon was beautiful and Nafees shared photography knowledge and tips.<br /><br />

I would definitely recommend an adventure like this with Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>A few fun hours was spent with Nafees who was really great to speak to, learn about Lynn Canyon, and Photography. He really gave us several nice tips on how to compose a landscape. The trek through Lynn Canyon is quite easy so the great conversation about Vancouver was welcomed to keep the hours moving quickly. Definitely an experience that is easily accessible to anyone and all ages. I would suggest the other experiences if you want something a bit advanced than a well worn walking path.<br /><br />
      <li>Expect stunning views, a private tour with lots of landscape and nature photographic objects. Also, expect to have in depth discussions with Nafees, who is not just knowledgeable about the area, but also a very intelligent person. No regret, it was time and money well spent when we were in Vancouver, better than Capilano IMHO.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is so prompt, communicative and fun to hang with. I got a masterclass in photography while taking in a beautiful park. Nafees was great at helping balance photography time and time to take photos of me / enjoy our surroundings. He was also great at talking about Vancouver and things he’d recommend I experience. Can’t say enough about him! Do. this. experience.<br /><br />
      <li>It is a great hike and Nafees definitely knows the right spots at Lynn Canyon, and has a good eye for photography.

      <li>Nafees is a great company and takes lovely pictures. He showed us great views and how to capture them. This was my first time in B.C. and he was very helpful and very polite. He even got down at our station to direct us to a lovely restaurant he suggested. I would recommend booking an experience with him if you visit Vancouver. Thanks Nafees great restaurant by the way.<br /><br />
      <li>This hike was the definition of amazing. From the towering trees to the waterfalls, I couldn&#8217;t ask for more. Nafees took me through multiple snow covered trails, taught me the history of the forest, and blew my mind with camera skills and techniques. The photos he provided me were some of the most stunning images I&#8217;ve ever seem. They are the kind of pictures that make you smile and feel good reminiscing of the moment in time. I would recommend this hike to anyone, the forest is another world and a great place to feel one with nature.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a wonderful, knowledgeable guide on our hike. We had so much fun!!!<br /><br />
      <li>Unique experiences! We shared lots of funny ideas about taking pictures and absorbed professional advices by Nafees.<br /><br />
      <li>We had a fun and very interesting tour in Lynn Canyon with Nafees. He taught us to take very good photos there, definitely a one of my favourites activities that I did in Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees got us out bright and early so we could get the best individual shots especially on the bridges. He helped us take so many pictures &#8211; it was like having a good friend who wants to help you have all the best memories on camera. The various locations he pointed out made this extra helpful. Right after the trip, he sent us pics that he took with his professional camera too. I enjoyed the entire experience!<br /><br />
      <li>The hike was very nice, and Nafees is very professional and friend. He adapted for my time. I had a good morning!<br /><br />
      <li>So fantastic and very insightful<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees had to cancel because of bad weather. But he was very communicative and professional throughout.<br /><br />
      <li>Lynn park is a nice place to walking, about 2hr hiking time, both children and older can make it as well. I am so lucky for the sunny morning, the weather is perfect for outdoor activity. Nafees is good communication, he can give very specific answers for all of the questions. It’s a good experience at all.<br /><br />
      <li>This is my second activity offered by Nafees that I booked, the other one being snowshoeing. I thoroughly enjoyed hiking Lynn Canyon even on a cloudy day. Everywhere you turn looks so magical like an enchanted forest. Nafees will give you really useful advice on photography and will gamely take photos of you as well. I highly recommend this tour for solo travelers like me who love nature and meeting new friends.<br /><br />
      <li>Can’t say enough about Nafees and how great our experience was. He was knowledgeable, organized, and fun to hike with. We showed up with our iPhones and left with some amazing pictures. I would recommend the experience to anyone&#8230; our only regret was that we didn’t bring cash to tip with!<br /><br />
      <li>Amazing tour with amazing guide!Learn a lot about photography in this trip.<br /><br />
      <li>We throughly enjoyed every moment of it! Our tour guide we cannot thank him enough for his guidance and knowledge of this exceptional rain forest park. Oh and if you’re going in winter “Watch your step”<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is an amazing tourguide and a great photography instructor!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees made this a fun and interesting experience even in the cold wet weather. Would definitely recommend!<br /><br />
      <li>We had a fun time talking with Nafees and hiking Lynn Canyon. Despite the rain, we had a good time taking pictures and just getting out of the city into nature. Nafees was very helpful, meeting us at our location, and the bus ride out was fun because Nafees offered suggestions and it gave us a a chance to see some different areas of Vancouver. It was an easy walk through the trees and something families could do easily. Thanks, Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>It was amazing! Just a 40 minutes bus rise and we where in the middle of the nature discovering such a beautiful place. Nafees is very kind and patient and we had nice conversations. Will absolutely recommend this experience when you are in Vancouver!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was an amazing tourguide, he knows his way around the canyon, and offered some great suggestions for places to visit in and outside the city, very kind and nice<br /><br />
      <li><span lang="en">The host was very attentive</span><br /><br />
      <li>The activity was incredible and Nafees is a kind and patient person and he takes amazing pictures, I totally recommend him.<br /><br />
      <li>Naffee becomes your friend automatically, he&#8217;s a like-able guy with a lot of Nature knowledge in both hiking and photography! I am a street photographer with experience and I still found myself learning a lot about how different it can be to shoot nature. We did time-lapses and found the best nooks to stop, take in the view, and breathe in the delicious fresh air. &#8230;I kinda want to be back there. Thanks Naffee!<br /><br />
      <li>I was surprised to get a full refund for not being able to hike Lynn suspended bridge. I definitely will enjoy this experience with Nafees in the near future. thanks for your timely communication and understanding. Thanks<br /><br />
      <li>Naseef was great! I highly recommend this experience to everyone, especially those who are traveling alone, such as myself. Not only that he gave excellent advice within photography, but he also enriched my knowledge when it comes to Vancouver. Thank you again, Naseef. I can&#8217;t wait to come back, and go on his other tours.<br /><br />
      <li>I would definitely recommend this! Nafees was a great guide, I learned a lot about the city in addition to getting photography tips and seeing some beautiful nature.<br /><br />
      <li>I really enjoyed having this experience with Nafees. He is very enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He helped us a lot when trying to find the more photogenic spots to shoot during the journey. The park we visited is really nice and the walk was confortable. Very good experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees met my husband and I near a bus stop and paid for our ride to the Lynn Canyon Park. During our ride he asked about our experience with photography then answered our questions about the area. During our walk in this beautiful park he helped each of us to challenge our norm for photography by helping us to perfect how to approach a picture. My husband is at a higher level of ability with a big camera and I was trying to break away from my iPhone camera and to learn to use a canon power shot G1x that we had. We our both excited about the skills that Nafees shared and will continue to practice these. Nafees also shared restaurants he loves and how to get to them. We will definitely come back and try some of his hiking trips he takes people on! He is a very intelligent, patient and kind person.<br /><br />
      <li>A great afternoon! Nafees was a great guide. He is knowledgeable about the area and photography and this experience was exactly what I was looking for and exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this experience. I wanted to practice my photography and also see the beautiful landscape. Nafees provided great feedback and praise. He mentioned in the winter time he may offer a snow shoe experience. If I visit the area during that time I will be sure to check it out. I would recommend this experience in a heartbeat!<br /><br />
      <li>I had a lot of fun! He was very casual and nice. He taught me a lot about the local places to go and where to hike! I also learnt a lot and took pictures I didn&#8217;t know I was capable of taking.<br /><br />
      <li>It rained a lot during the trip, but that just made the scenery and experience that much more special. Nafees is very knowledgeable and fun to talk to. Thanks!<br /><br />
      <li>If you want to see amazing views and landscapes this is a must experience to try .<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great guide. Organised, friendly, and really knowledgeable on photography. I learnt a lot and had heaps of fun. Cheers<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is very friendly and makes you feel secure when you use your camera, he explains the ways of getting the subject in the right place, and improve the pic. He knows the park very well and chooses many different localisations to work on. Then I liked my &#8220;after tour home work&#8221;,he asked me to chose my 3 top pic and send them to him with my comments.I found that very interesting to look differently at the pic and analyse from artistic and technical point. He send me his comments too. Lynn Park is a very magic place&#8230;<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is great and professional not only in photography but with showing the interesting places. He has been helpful to me with everything. Thank you again.<br /><br />
      <li>Totally recommend! The location and experience were amazing, Lynn Canyon is gorgeous!! I got reintroduced to my camera after a very long break. Nafees is very friendly, helpful and a good teacher. I&#8217;m glad I booked this event because it was one of the most favorite things I did during my trip. Thank you Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience! Nafees is very patient and he taught me a lot of skills in photo taking, really like it!<br /><br />
      <li>I had a great day with Nafees: we could chat a lot about Vancouver, Canada, Travling and Hiking and once at Lynn Canyon (awesome place!) he also helped me a lot with my first steps in landscape photography. As I just started with handing an SR camera, it was great to learn about variuos settings as well as picture composition, while walking through the autunm forrest. Thanks a lot, Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>Great guide, lots of fun!<br /><br />
      <li>I had a delightful experience exploring Lynn Canyon Park with Nafees as my guide. Expect a mild to moderate level hike, and to take lots of photos of towering trees, clear pools, waterfalls, and more. Nafees has years of experience leading hiking groups in Vancouver and his love for and knowledge of the outdoors makes him a great hike companion. He&#8217;s welcoming and funny, and he gave me great advice on how to improve my photos. I would absolutely join another one of his hiking groups if I return to Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>It was a really interesting afternoon, i was showed nice photo spots and he gave really good advices!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is very nice! He gave me lots of recommendations where to check out. Lynn Canyon is beautiful too. Definitely recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>I was the only one on the tour that day, so he was basically my personal. Saw some great scenery and I learn some photography tips which I intend to keep practicing.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was very knowledgeable about the canyon and photography. He knew the best places to take photos and we really enjoyed the experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Our Guide Nafees&#8230; Knowledgeable, friendly, patient, and accommodating Our Experience&#8230; Beautiful, majestic, inspirational and entertaining, especially the warning signs about diving Our Recommendation&#8230; Sign up with Nafees&#8217; next experience and you will get great photos and great memories&#8230;.we did! Cheers<br /><br />
      <li>My experience with Nafees was amazing! Lynn Canyon is a very beautiful area (also recommended by other Vancouver residents as a must-see hiking spot). It was a great photography technical refresher as well, something that I needed and I continued to utilize what I learned throughout the rest of my trip. He is a very good instructor and very patient. He also has a lot of knowledge and recommendations about the local area of Vancouver. Thanks for a great experience!<br /><br />
      <li>It was a great experience with Nafees! He is an easy-going tour guide and knows the places very well! Recommended to anyone who interest in the natural places in Vancouver!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was great—relaxed, knowledgeable, helpful and overall a really nice guy. My kids and I had so much fun!<br /><br />
      <li>This experience was so well orchestrated and fun: it&#8217;s full of picturesque scenery and great photography lessons without it being stressful. It&#8217;s a must do for those of who want an outdoor excursion away from the city. Importantly, Nafees is great &#8212; he is very passionate about what he does; is extremely knowledgeable about the outdoors, photography, and Vancouver; and is very flexible about making the trip suit your needs. On top of this, he&#8217;s very communicative and all around awesome!<br /><br />
      <li>I had a really good afternoon with Nafees and our group. The hike was great fun and Nafees gave some photography tips which meant I was really happy with the photos I took! Nafees was fun to be with and created a great atmosphere in the group. I would highly recommend this trip!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a great tour guide, very knowledgable and entertaining. The tour was absolutely amazing and the views stunning. Would definitely recommend this tour to anyone 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>The hike is great (eventhough it is a bit of a workout) and the views on top are breathtaking! And it&#8217;s only a short ride from the city. Definitely a must-do when in Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>The hike had some spectacular views and we had super fun (and some decent cardio) in the snow. Nafees is a great to be along with and he takes some really cool pictures 🙂 He also obliged to some extra requests from us to take more photos. Truly, a delightful person guiding our hike. Overall, the experience was nothing short of exceptional, as everything from procuring the train tickets to putting your snow shoes right was taken care of by Nafees and there wasn&#8217;t anything amiss. I&#8217;d definitely recommend this to people visiting VanC in winter if you&#8217;re keen on snowshoeing.<br /><br />
      <li>I didn&#8217;t know what to expect from snowshoeing, but it turned out to be a short, mild hike on Mt. Seymour. We were quite lucky because it had snowed very recently and everything was still covered in snow and very beautiful. Nafees was personable and knowledgeable.<br /><br />
      <li>Hiking with Nafees was great! Everything was super well organized and the location was really nice 🙂 Nafees is very friendly and helpful, and we all had a really good time. Our hike to Mount Seymour was really easy and targetted at beginners. If you are used to hiking and are looking for a minimally-challenging one, I suggest you talk to Nafees first!<br /><br />
      <li>Nicest guy ever. Totally chill. Experienced guide. Nafees handles all train and bus tranfers, gear&#8230;.takes photos. Cannot sat enough good things.<br /><br />
      <li>Everything was very well organized! Nafees is a very good guide, he took good care of you. The tour through the area was fantastically beautiful, it was so much fun to hike with the snowshoes. In between, we shot photos of nature and here, too, knew Nafees very well! Thank&#8217;s for the Tipps. When we arrived at the summit, everything was cloudy and had no prospect. No 5 minutes later, a window opened and we had the most beautiful view of downtown. That had been a magical moment for us! I recommend everyone this tour, a little diversion to the normal sightseeing tour.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was such a fun and helpful guide throughout the entire hike. I learned so many hiking tips from him and loved that he was able to help with photography. Highly recommend this experience because it definitely was one of the best parts of my Vancouver trip.<br /><br />
      <li>It was wonderful. We met at the Warfront Station at 8:25 am and then took the public transport to the shuttle bus which took us to the mountain. Once there, there was a brief briefing on the use of snowshoes. After the briefing we made our way to a very nice vantage point. In between was always enough for photos food and drink. The view was beautiful. The way there was not crowded because of the time. Nafees was friendly the entire time and answered all our questions. He was always in a good mood and used to jokes. All in all a very nice day. This tour is highly recommended.<br /><br />
      <li>Great Powder Day!<br /><br />
      <li>We had a great afternoon with Nafees in the snow. Highly recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a great guide, very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about Vancouver outdoors and snow shoeing in particular. The trip was well organised, he answered all our questions before hand and the hike in the snow through beautiful forest was fun. It was snowing on the day we went, so we didnt get much of a view over Vancouver, but the trail was great.<br /><br />
      <li>We had extremely fun time, and took lots of interesting pictures! I’ll come back in April<br /><br />
      <li>We had such a great time on our snowshoeing tour! Nafees is a fantastic guide. He was so well organized and very knowledgeable about snowshoeing. The Dog Mountain trail is great for beginner snowshoers and the view at the end is incredible. I would definitely do a tour with Nafees again!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was quick to respond to questions, super knowledgeable, friendly, engaged, and ready to roll. We had snowshoed before but it was still good to have a guide and be with someone who knows the area and the drill. The trip was a ton of fun and had no shortage of gorgeous views and closely knotted in trees, we would love to see what other adventures Nafees might lead in the future!<br /><br />
      <li>Highly recommend snowshoeing with Nafees. He was a terrific from the start. Good communication prior to the day on what to bring, wear and what to expect. Mt. Seymour is beautiful covered in snow<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a very friendly person, I am glad that you met him in Vancouver, he organized the great journey through the snow snow shoes, his photography is also very good, our family spent a wonderful day, thanks to Nafees, I recommend to all my friends, so that they can feel Vancouver the beauty of winter!<br /><br />
      <li>One of my favorite activities while in Vancouver! A must do! Thanks Nafees for such a nice hiking experience! 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>Host was kind and great. Also the hiking was wonderful. I feel lile I&#8217;m in fantasy.<br /><br />
      <li>The tour was everything I had hoped for! Nafees was so friendly and patient with us. He introduced us to snow shoeing and taught us how to do it (it&#8217;s so easy to get the hang of), and we all set off up Dog Mountain. Such a fun experience and a great way to see the snow and outdoors 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>It was a very enjoyable winter hike. Nafees provided all the logistics and he was very punctual. During the hike, we had great conversation on various topics and he helped to take some really good shots of me in the snowy terrains. He was very professional and accommodating despite the fact he only had one guest (who was myself) for this trip. Nafees was clearly a travel enthusiast who was very willing to offer recommendations on various key places to visit in Vancouver. I would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to try out hiking in winter wearing snowshoes and to enjoy Vancouver for an unique experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Had a really great time with Nafees and the rest of the group on this snowshoe hike. Nafees is a really nice guy, super-easy to get along with, and he took some super photos of our trip. Thanks Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>I loved my day with Nafees. It was great fun! Well worth putting up with the cold to experience real snow. I&#8217;d like to do it again! And thanks for the great photos Nafees. Cheers, Tom<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was really friendly and attentive, and the hike was beautifully scenic and just the right length. 5 Stars!<br /><br />
      <li>This was such an awesome experience! It was actually snowing when we went, which I think is the best time to go. Nafees is an amazing host. He takes care of all of the logistics (train, shuttle, bus, tickets, etc.) so you don’t have to worry about anything. He is fun to be around with and knows many cool facts about Vancouver. He also teaches you a few pointers about photography and takes high quality pictures of you throughout the hike. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to take a quick break from the city!<br /><br />
      <li>What a fantastic way to be introduced to my first winter activity! Nafees was very chill and comfortable to be with. And like he said, if you can walk you can snowshoe. The trails were manageable and the reward at the summit was truly Instagram-worthy!<br /><br />
      <li>Amazing tour with amazing guide!Learn a lot about photography in this trip.<br /><br />
      <li>Snowshoeing was very cool! Mt seymore is beautiful!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is the coolest tour guide ever!! You&#8217;ll leave feeling like you made a new best friend. The trail was definitely doable for any relatively fit beginner, and its absolutely beautiful. I had never done snowshoeing before, but now I think I will invest in a pair of snowshoes. By the way, he loves having snowballs thrown at him! Haha.<br /><br />
      <li>Very rewarding view &amp; jovial host 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>I did a snowshoeing trip to Cypress to do the Bowen Lookout tour and it was very nice!!!!! The organisation was well done, the atmosphere as well and Nafees is a very passionated person. I highly recommend you do go with them to meet nice people. have fun, discover new place and have good time 😉 !!!<br /><br />
      <li>I did a snowshoeing trip to the top of Hollyburn Peak at Cypress Mountain. It was fun but hard work. The view at the top though was SO worth it. Nafees was a great guide and very patient, gave us all instructions on how to put on snowshoes properly and other tips on using it. We took frequent breaks and he gave me some pointers on how to improve my photos. Highly recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>I&#8217;ve been in couple of hikes with this group and those were amazing!! Nafees knows what he does. Being introvert I was a little scared when I started, but people are super amicable there. Just get there and prepare to be demented 🙂<br /><br />
      <li>Me and My girlfriend wanted to go hiking and snowshoeing with this group of hiker since a while ago. We had been told that this is an awesome group, with nice energy and wonderful tour guide, Nafees. We had been 100% positively satisfied! Nafees is a good organizer, we had a lot of details before the day of the hike with some advice and warning about weather, clothes or/and gears required for the event. The event was in a nice mood and a truly a really good and positive atmosphere. Nafees cares about everybody, beginners and advanced hikers and he is really trustworthy! I highly recommend going hike with this group! I will myself go with them again for sure.<br /><br />
      <li>The hike was very personal and diverse. I was taught how to optimize my camera and what to look for when taking scenery pictures. We walked up to the lake at a comfortable pace. It was very friendly group and I recommend it this tour to anyone, who is passionate about the outdoors.<br /><br />
      <li>We bought vouchers on Social Shopper as we both love to take pictures of nature and walk in nature as well. This was the best of both. We did the Lynn Canyon Hike. We saw spectacular views and were assisted to use our cameras better. Nafees is knowledgeable, helpful and very patient. He was able to move from a DSL to a point and shoot with ease. Both of us having had our cameras for some years will now use them more to our advantage. Being able to do a hike to get the pictures in such a beautiful setting was also a bonus. We both felt this was a beneficial day spent learning, enjoying and getting to know Nafees. Recommend it highly.<br /><br />
      <li>The instructor/guide (Nafees) taught me the basics in two hours for manual, aperture, and shutter speed settings. Now I have a much better understanding of how to use these. He also helped out with advice on composition on my camera shots and some printed photos that I brought along. All in all very worthwhile.<br /><br />
      <li>Vancouver is a very beautiful city with a lot of beautiful nature planted right into the urban oasis that is the city. However, to truly experience the awe inspiring nature that most of us flock from all around the world to see you really need explore the coastal mountain ranges that tower just behind the cityscape.<br /><br />
      <li>I experienced these mountains with Nafees as my awesome guide on one of his photo tours to St. Mark&#8217;s Summit. We discovered breathtaking landscapes and unreal views of the Howe Sound water body which me and my shiny new Nikon were very keen to do justice in capturing. Nafees gave me a great walkthrough on many key photography essentials as well as some cool advanced tips for the specific controls on my camera that brought a whole new dramatic element to my pictures. The photos I took on his photo tours are definitely the creme of the crop of those in my Vancouver experience album.<br /><br />
      <li>I would highly recommend making it out for one of Nafees&#8217; photo tours if you&#8217;re lucky enough to be in town when they happen. I&#8217;ll definitely be doing another one the next time I get the chance!<br /><br />
      <li>Undertook a trip to Garibaldi Provincial Park. A place not on the conventional tourist itinery but I would strongly recommned both that you visit the park (with Nature PhotoHikes) and go on this trip. I enjoy walking and I enjoy taking photos &#8211; and having the time to take photos &#8211; and this trip was a highlight of my visit to Vancouver.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is an awesome guide. He&#8217;s super organized, genuine and personable. He was able to handle the group well and also took the time to talk and connect with all individuals. Our tour was very smooth and fun. Nafees took care of all the logistics while we enjoyed a lunch at Horseshoe Bay.<br /><br />
      <li>The walk around Bowen Island was lovely and enjoyable. It&#8217;s an easy hike and accessible to anyone who is able to walk for a couple of hours. There were lots of great photo opportunities around the lake and Nafees was great at explaining the intricacies on how to create better photos.<br /><br />
      <li>This is actually a huge thing for me as I used to take the worst photos! In fact, I pretty much gave up on photography altogether and resigned to the fact that I was &#8220;one of those people&#8221; who&#8217;s photos just sucked. Nafees got me excited about photography to the point that I now use Instagram almost everyday (yes, I&#8217;m not hardcore yet to buy a SLR)! Highly recommended!<br /><br />
      <li>I finally understand how to use the manual settings on my camera. Nafees gave us really good tips on picture composition as well. Can&#8217;t wait to take more pictures with the manual settings on my SLR camera.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a super cool guy. I met him through a hike that he organized. He definitely know&#8217;s his way around Vancouver and has probably hiked every possible trail around it. Whether it&#8217;s a walk in the park or or up a steep mountain you should take the opportunity to go for a hike with Nafees.<br /><br />
      <li>I booked the Lynn Canyon and Quarry Rock tour to see a few sights during my visit to Vancouver. Both tours were of the shorter/beginner level variety (2 hour hikes) but was still able to get in a workout and see fantastic views. Nafees, the tour guide, is very knowledgable about the area as well as beginner and advanced photography techniques. He was willing to answer lots of questions and focused on educating the group about the technical and artistic aspects of landscape photography. I went from using my automatic settings to using the manual settings on my SLR camera for the remainder of my trip in Vancouver! I also purchased the transportation add on for the tours which were super convenient and well worth the cost since the hikes were relatively far from where I was staying and I was without a car. Overall I would highly recommend Nature Photo Hikes &#8211; and look forward to booking a tour in the future for one of the more advance hikes!<br /><br />
      <li>My partner and I booked a hike with Nash to the Joffre Lakes and it was incredible. The trails are very well prepped so not very challenging but still a great workout with the elevation and time involved! It was about 2.5 hours to the top and 2 hours down. The three lakes are stunning, each lake more awesome then the prior and at the top you can see the glacier where the lakes are fed! There are several waterfalls and scenic stops all along the trails. Nash was a great guide highlighting the best spots and providing answers to all of our questions. Nash gave us recommendations for other places to see in Vancouver and also great dinner spots! Definitely not your typical cattle call tour with Nash made for a truly unforgettable day!!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is an excellent photographer and creative hiking guide of BC! Can&#8217;t wait to explore more hidden gems with him and his 20+crew of fellow photographing hikers!!!<br /><br />
      <li>I met Nafees on a photo tour and he gave me a lot of great advice on photography skills. He is knowledgeable and has a passion for capturing the moment. Thank you for the great time!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is a knowledgeable photographer and was able to give me a lot of good points on how to use a point and shoot camera and understand the different settings. I would definitely recommend attending any one of his photo tours. Great company too.<br /><br />
      <li>I joined a couple of Nafees&#8217; hikes during the summer of 2015. We went to Garibaldi Lakes and Joffre Lakes both of them astonishing places. My eyes couldn&#8217;t believe what I was seeing! He has great knowledge of the trails and knows where the best spots to take pictures are. The group was really well organized and he always makes sure that no one stays behind. He lets you know what you should bring for every hike so that nothing is missing the day of&#8230;including swimsuit in case you want to take a dip in glacier water! :S Great experience overall!<br /><br />
      <li>Highly recommend! Nafees is incredibly knowledgeable and I learned so much about photography and Lynn Canyon. I felt comfortable with Nafees&#8217; guidance and he really goes above and beyond to make your experience a personal one. If you appreciate the serenity of &#8220;hidden gems,&#8221; then this is the one for you. So happy that I decided to book this experience!<br /><br />
      <li>A great experience. I would have never found all the hidden and less crowded trails without Nafees. And I learned so much about Vancouver in the process.<br /><br />
      <li>Lynn Valley is gorgeous. We wouldn’t have it done when I didn’t see this photo tour of Nafees. It was the right combination of exploring a new spot, enjoying nature and getting professional help from photographic aspects. He really cared about everyone no matter which gear one had. I really recommend this tour to explore the valley differently. There could be also a day tour to see even more of the nice area.<br /><br />
      <li>I had a very nice day with Nafees and a small family from England, who also did the tour. Nafees is very attentive, takes care of his guests individually and gives good tips for better photos. The tour leads to the Lynn Canyon, which was a bit fuller than expected but still great! I can only recommend the company!<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience! I was worried about hiking by myself, so it was great having Nafees give the tour. We went to a bunch of beautiful spots in the area. There are a lot of steep steps so potentially not appropriate for older or injured people.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was an awesome guide and is quite knowledgeable about both photography and hiking.<br /><br />
      <li>He gave me some cool tips &amp; he interacted with everyone in the group well.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a friendly guide, showing you how to catch public transport including buses and seabus (public transport day ticket $10.50 adult, $8.25 child) to get to/from Lynn Valley Park from/to downtown Vancouver. Travel time was about an hour each way. You had roughly 2 hours in Lynn Canyon where you walked the lovely old growth forest trails, crossed a suspension bridge, viewed waterfalls and had the option to swim in the cool (10degC) river waters if you wanted to. Apparently much less busy than the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park (and no entry fee here) but there were still heaps of tourists/locals. Nafees shared some simple history/info of the region and gave some tips for photo shooting with our smartphones. Nafees was a very approachable host happy to answer questions during and post tour. Nice small group size (4 people) for our adventure.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was great to work with. He took care of transportation to and from Mt. Seymour. Throughout the excursion, our well-being was a priority to him. Additionally, he showed a lot of patience and understanding when my anxiety got the best of me at the top of the mountain. My photography skills improved because of teaching. This is a great experience because you get a guide for the hike and a photography teacher. 48 hours later, he emailed me the pictures he took of my family. I couldn’t imagine having this experience without his help.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees provided a well planned tour including transportation. He was knowledgeable of the area, able to highlight great photo opportunities, and was able to cater feedback from the novice to advanced level. If you want to see the natural beauty of Canada’s rain forests without the tourist trappings then this is the tour for you. Lynn Canyon trumps Capilano any day.<br /><br />
      <li>Fantastic Tour. Nafees really helped me to understand my camera and how to adjust the setting to suit the environment I was shooting in. Nafees also had a lot of knowledge about the area and went out of his way to show us the best spots to take photos. Great experience!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is an excellent, patient, and thoughtful hiking and photography host! Some parts of the snowshoeing hike were a bit icy, but at no point did I feel the need to rush or feel uncomfortable about maneuvering the path. He was able to provide very good outdoor photography tips, pointed out excellent points of interest for good shots, and even took many for us and gave us pose tips and ideas. I&#8217;m so happy I did this experience because the views were spectacular and snowshoeing was so fun.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was amazing. He knew small details about the nooks and corners of the canyon and showed us some amazing locations. Even though we didn’t have a camera, he showed us very interesting techniques on our camera phones. My fiancé had an injured foot and Nafees took additional care of where he is putting his feet all throughout the trip. He is knowledgeable and also gave us additional information on rest of Vancouver. I would highly recommend this experience.<br /><br />
      <li>I went on this hike with Nafees on Jan 1st. It was a nice experience. The photography lessons that he provided were very helpful and handy. I just started learning photography and the lessons I had are more clear than the youtube tutorials I watched. Nafees was also a great host who can patiently answer your questions and also you can have good conversations with.<br /><br />
      <li>A great experience! Not only is Nafees experienced in hiking and snowshoeing but the knowledge he has is perfect for any beginners to advance hikers who would like to explore the snowy Mt. Seymour. The view on top is rewarding! Weather can be unpredictable but Nafees tries his best to pick days where the view can be seen once you reach the top.<br /><br />
      <li>Mr. Nafees was very kind and told me various things. He knew the area well, so I was able to take pictures that I could go around efficiently. It was good that I got new knowledge. However, it was good that I was able to take my own photo because I was traveling alone, and I was able to sight see the night life at ease.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was really kind and taught me many things. He knows how and when to take good photos, so I could take nice photos efficiently. It was also nice for me that he took photos of me and I could explore the city safely because I was traveling by myself. Thank you Nafees!<br /><br />
      <li>So worth your money, has such an amazing personality, and will make you feel like friend instead of just a customer who purchased his tour. I would do it again &amp; will be considering his other tours when I come back. I was a tourist from Arizona.<br /><br />
      <li>Great day at Mt Seymour. Nafees was very careful making sure everyone was following the group without leaving anyone behind or pushing too much. I fell in love with snowshoeing and I&#8217;m adding one to each of my ski trips going forward.<br /><br />
      <li>It was a great experience and Nafees was really patience with me, he help me a lot and I truly lived a great experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Took impressive photos.<br /><br />
      <li>Amazing.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees is an excellent guide. He taught me several things about how can I take pictures. And how can I take better pictures with my cellphone. I recommend him.<br /><br />
      <li>Great tour, Nafees is very good and the tour is amazing, I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />
      <li>Easy trek! For beginners only. Nafees was great and made sure everyone is at ease!<br /><br />
      <li>I loved it. Got some great photos and got to enjoy nature again. I recommend this tour to anyone coming to visit Vancouver Canada.<br /><br />
      <li>Truly expert local knowledge! Very scenic hike.<br /><br />
      <li>Amazing views. If it rains it is waterproof.<br /><br />
      <li>It is an amazing place with beautiful views.<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was great. We truly enjoyed Bowen island with him and Derrick.<br /><br />
      <li>This was such a special birthday gift for a friend.<br /><br />
      <li>Great experience.<br /><br />
      <li>Wonderful half day journey!<br /><br />
      <li>Nafees was a great host and guide thru and thru! If you wish to visit the wilderness and capture the moment in the best possible way, join Nafees in Lynn Canyon.<br /><br />
      <li>Really good hiking!!!<br /><br />
      <li>I highly recommend!!<br /><br />
