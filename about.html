		<h2>About Nature PhotoHikes</h2>

			<p><img src="http://naturephotohikes.com/images/profile2.jpg" width="50%" align="right" style="padding:15px"><strong><em>"Discover nature, not the resort" </em></strong>- Nature PhotoHikes takes you off the beaten path through hiking and photography lessons. We guarantee a fun and safe experience while connecting you with other nature and photography enthusiasts. As our guest, you believe in buying experiences (not things) and taking pictures (not souvenirs)! </p>
			
			<p>Our hikes are based on physical ability, from half day easy walks to multiple day camping trips in Vancouver, BC and the Rockies, AB. Everyone of varying skills is welcome to attend, whether you carry a DSLR or iPhone. Our small groups allow for one-on-one, customized, instructions as well as keen attention to your hiking experience. Although we teach landscape photography, there is more to the concept than photographing just mountains and lakes. There's a fine line between landscape and the abstract, which allows the traveler to capture more than the 'I was here' photos.</p>
			
			<p>Our photographer and guide, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nafees/albums" target="_blank">Nafees Shams</a>, is an avid traveler, photographer and hiker. Spending over a decade each in British Columbia and Alberta, he has organized hikes for 20+ years for locals and visitors. He has also traveled to 56 countries in 6 continents, and lived in 7 of them. He founded Nature PhotoHikes 5 years ago, where he shares his love of landscape photography. His tours include guided hikes/walks, photo shoots and lessons with DSLR or smartphone. He also organizes community hikes for local charities and youth groups, including refugees and newcomers to Canada. He loves to share his passion for travel, the outdoors and photography with everyone!</p>
			
			<p>Feel free to browse through our <a href="/faq-template/faq.html" target="_blank">FAQs</a> for commonly asked questions.</p>

			<!--<p>You can combine multiple tours and hikes to save on packages, in addition to saving on group rates. We also offer post-tour lessons on enhancing your photos through various software as well as learning to make videos.</p>-->

			<h3>Giving back to the community</h3><br />

			<p>Nafees founded and organized hiking groups for over ten years, on a volunteer basis. Running weekly hikes near Vancouver and road trips to Alberta, Northern BC, Yukon, Alaska and western US, he created a community of over 1,000 members with a shared love of the outdoors. The hikes also raise funds and awareness for different charities, donating thousands of dollars for the homeless, refugees and at risk youth. Nature PhotoHikes continues with this same philosophy of creating community and helping worthwhile causes.
